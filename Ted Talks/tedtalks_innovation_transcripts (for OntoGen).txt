1	"So there's a lot of validconcern these daysthat our technology is getting so smartthat we've put ourselveson the path to a jobless future.And I think the exampleof a self-driving caris actually the easiest one to see.So these are going to be fantasticfor all kinds of different reasons.But did you know that \"driver\"is actually the most common jobin 29 of the 50 US states?What's going to happen to these jobswhen we're no longer driving our carsor cooking our foodor even diagnosing our own diseases? Well, a recent studyfrom Forrester Researchgoes so far to predictthat 25 million jobsmight disappear over the next 10 years.To put that in perspective,that's three times as many jobs lostin the aftermath of the financial crisis.And it's not just blue-collar jobsthat are at risk.On Wall Street and across Silicon Valley,we are seeing tremendous gainsin the quality of analysisand decision-makingbecause of machine learning.So even the smartest, highest-paid peoplewill be affected by this change. What's clear is that no matterwhat your job is,at least some, if not all of your work,is going to be done by a robotor software in the next few years.And that's exactly why peoplelike Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gatesare talking about the need forgovernment-funded minimum income levels.But if our politicians can't agreeon things like health careor even school lunches,I just don't see a pathwhere they'll find consensuson something as big and as expensiveas universal basic life income.Instead, I think the responseneeds to be led by us in industry.We have to recognizethe change that's ahead of usand start to design the new kinds of jobsthat will still be relevantin the age of robotics. The good news is that we havefaced down and recoveredtwo mass extinctions of jobs before.From 1870 to 1970,the percent of American workersbased on farms fell by 90 percent,and then again from 1950 to 2010,the percent of Americansworking in factoriesfell by 75 percent.The challenge we face this time,however, is one of time.We had a hundred yearsto move from farms to factories,and then 60 years to fully build outa service economy.The rate of change todaysuggests that we may only have10 or 15 years to adjust,and if we don't react fast enough,that means by the timetoday's elementary-school studentsare college-aged,we could be livingin a world that's robotic,largely unemployed and stuckin kind of un-great depression. But I don't think it has to be this way.You see, I work in innovation,and part of my job is to shape howlarge companies apply new technologies.Certainly some of these technologiesare even specifically designedto replace human workers.But I believe that if we starttaking steps right nowto change the nature of work,we can not only create environmentswhere people love coming to workbut also generatethe innovation that we needto replace the millions of jobsthat will be lost to technology.I believe that the keyto preventing our jobless futureis to rediscover what makes us human,and to create a new generationof human-centered jobsthat allow us to unlockthe hidden talents and passionsthat we carry with us every day. But first, I thinkit's important to recognizethat we brought this problem on ourselves.And it's not just because, you know,we are the one building the robots.But even though most jobsleft the factory decades ago,we still hold on to this factory mindsetof standardization and de-skilling.We still define jobsaround procedural tasksand then pay people for the numberof hours that they perform these tasks.We've created narrow job definitionslike cashier, loan processoror taxi driverand then asked peopleto form entire careersaround these singular tasks. These choices have left us withactually two dangerous side effects.The first is that thesenarrowly defined jobswill be the firstto be displaced by robots,because single-task robotsare just the easiest kinds to build.But second, we have accidentally made itso that millions of workersaround the worldhave unbelievably boring working lives. (Laughter) Let's take the exampleof a call center agent.Over the last few decades,we brag about lower operating costsbecause we've taken mostof the need for brainpowerout of the personand put it into the system.For most of their day,they click on screens,they read scripts.They act more like machines than humans.And unfortunately,over the next few years,as our technology gets more advanced,they, along with peoplelike clerks and bookkeepers,will see the vast majorityof their work disappear. To counteract this,we have to start creating new jobsthat are less centeredon the tasks that a person doesand more focused on the skillsthat a person brings to work.For example, robots are greatat repetitive and constrained work,but human beings have an amazing abilityto bring togethercapability with creativitywhen faced with problemsthat we've never seen before.It's when every daybrings a little bit of a surprisethat we have designed work for humansand not for robots.Our entrepreneurs and engineersalready live in this world,but so do our nurses and our plumbersand our therapists.You know, it's the natureof too many companies and organizationsto just ask people to come to workand do your job.But if you work is better done by a robot,or your decisions better made by an AI,what are you supposed to be doing? Well, I think for the manager,we need to realistically think aboutthe tasks that will be disappearingover the next few yearsand start planning for more meaningful,more valuable work that should replace it.We need to create environmentswhere both human beings and robots thrive.I say, let's give more work to the robots,and let's start with the workthat we absolutely hate doing.Here, robot,process this painfully idiotic report. (Laughter) And move this box. Thank you. (Laughter) And for the human beings,we should follow the advice from HarryDavis at the University of Chicago.He says we have to make it so that peopledon't leave too much of themselvesin the trunk of their car.I mean, human beingsare amazing on weekends.Think about the people that you knowand what they do on Saturdays.They're artists, carpenters,chefs and athletes.But on Monday, they're backto being Junior HR Specialistand Systems Analyst 3. (Laughter) You know, these narrow job titlesnot only sound boring,but they're actuallya subtle encouragementfor people to make narrowand boring job contributions.But I've seen firsthandthat when you invite people to be more,they can amaze uswith how much more they can be. A few years ago,I was working at a large bankthat was trying to bring more innovationinto its company culture.So my team and I designeda prototyping contestthat invited anyone to buildanything that they wanted.We were actually trying to figure outwhether or notthe primary limiter to innovationwas a lack of ideas or a lack of talent,and it turns out it was neither one.It was an empowerment problem.And the resultsof the program were amazing.We started by invitingpeople to reenvisionwhat it is they could bring to a team.This contest was not only a chanceto build anything that you wantedbut also be anything that you wanted.And when people were no longerlimited by their day-to-day job titles,they felt free to bring all kindsof different skills and talentsto the problemsthat they were trying to solve.We saw technology people being designers,marketing people being architects,and even finance people showing offtheir ability to write jokes. (Laughter) We ran this program twice,and each time more than 400 peoplebrought their unexpected talents to workand solved problems that they had beenwanting to solve for years.Collectively, they createdmillions of dollars of value,building things like a bettertouch-tone system for call centers,easier desktop tools for branchesand even a thank you card systemthat has become a cornerstoneof the employee working experience.Over the course of the eight weeks,people flexed muscles that they neverdreamed of using at work.People learned new skills,they met new people,and at the end, somebodypulled me aside and said,\"I have to tell you,the last few weeks has beenone of the most intense,hardest working experiencesof my entire life,but not one second of it felt like work.\"nAnd that's the key.For those few weeks, peoplegot to be creators and innovators.They had been dreaming of solutionsto problems that had beenbugging them for years,and this was a chance to turnthose dreams into a reality.And that dreaming is an important partof what separates us from machines.For now, our machinesdo not get frustrated,they do not get annoyed,and they certainly don't imagine. But we, as human beings —we feel pain,we get frustrated.And it's when we're most annoyedand most curiousthat we're motivated to diginto a problem and create change.Our imaginations are the birthplaceof new products, new services,and even new industries. I believe that the jobs of the futurewill come from the minds of peoplewho today we callanalysts and specialists,but only if we give them the freedomand protection that they need to growinto becoming explorers and inventors.If we really want to robot-proof our jobs,we, as leaders, needto get out of the mindsetof telling people what to doand instead start asking themwhat problems they're inspired to solveand what talentsthey want to bring to work.Because when you can bringyour Saturday self to work on Wednesdays,you'll look forward to Mondays more,and those feelingsthat we have about Mondaysare part of what makes us human. And as we redesign workfor an era of intelligent machines,I invite you all to work alongside meto bring more humanityto our working lives. Thank you. (Applause) We've all heard that robots are going to take our jobs — but what can we do about it? Innovation expert David Lee says that we should start designing jobs that unlock our hidden talents and passions — the things we spend our weekends doing — to keep us relevant in the age of robotics. \"Start asking people what problems they're inspired to solve and what talents they want to bring to work,\" Lee says. \"When you invite people to be more, they can amaze us with how much more they can be.\"nUPS’s David Lee works to create platforms that make it easier for people to turn fuzzy ideas into concrete solutions.

2	"A little over 100 years ago, in 1915,Einstein publishedhis theory of general relativity,which is sort of a strange name,but it's a theory that explains gravity.It states that mass — all matter,the planets — attracts mass,not because of an instantaneous force,as Newton claimed,but because all matter —all of us, all the planets —wrinkles the flexible fabricof space-time. Space-time is this thing in which we liveand that connects us all.It's like when we lie down on a mattressand distort its contour.The masses move — again,not according to Newton's laws,but because they seethis space-time curvatureand follow the little curves,just like when our bedmatenestles up to usbecause of the mattress curvature. (Laughter) A year later, in 1916,Einstein derived from his theorythat gravitational waves existed,and that these waves were producedwhen masses move,like, for example, when two starsrevolve around one anotherand create folds in space-timewhich carry energy from the system,and the stars move toward each other.However, he also estimatedthat these effects were so minute,that it would never be possibleto measure them.I'm going to tell you the story of how,with the work of hundreds of scientistsworking in many countriesover the course of many decades,just recently, in 2015,we discovered those gravitationalwaves for the first time. It's a rather long story.It started 1.3 billion years ago.A long, long time ago,in a galaxy far, far away —n(Laughter) two black holes were revolvingaround one another —\"dancing the tango,\" I like to say.It started slowly,but as they emitted gravitational waves,they grew closer together,accelerating in speed,until, when they were revolvingat almost the speed of light,they fused into a single black holethat had 60 times the mass of the Sun,but compressedinto the space of 360 kilometers.That's the size of the state of Louisiana,where I live.This incredible effectproduced gravitational wavesthat carried the news of this cosmic hugto the rest of the universe. It took us a long time to figure outthe effects of these gravitational waves,because the way we measure themis by looking for effects in distances.We want to measure longitudes, distances.When these gravitational wavespassed by Earth,which was in 2015,they produced changes in all distances —the distances between all of you,the distances between you and me,our heights —every one of usstretched and shrank a tiny bit.The prediction is that the effectis proportional to the distance.But it's very small:even for distances much greaterthan my slight height,the effect is infinitesimal.For example, the distancebetween the Earth and the Sunchanged by one atomic diameter.How can that be measured?How could we measure it? Fifty years ago,some visionary physicistsat Caltech and MIT —Kip Thorne, Ron Drever, Rai Weiss —thought they could preciselymeasure distancesusing lasers that measureddistances between mirrorskilometers apart.It took many years, a lot of workand many scientiststo develop the technologyand develop the ideas.And 20 years later,almost 30 years ago,they started to build two gravitationalwave detectors, two interferometers,in the United States.Each one is four kilometers long;one is in Livingston, Louisiana,in the middle of a beautiful forest,and the other is in Hanford, Washington,in the middle of the desert. The interferometers have lasersthat travel from the centerthrough four kilometers in-vacuum,are reflected in mirrorsand then they return.We measure the difference in the distancesbetween this arm and this arm.These detectors are very,very, very sensitive;they're the most preciseinstruments in the world.Why did we make two?It's because the signalsthat we want to measure come from space,but the mirrors are moving all the time,so in order to distinguishthe gravitational wave effects —which are astrophysical effectsand should show up on the two detectors —we can distinguish themfrom the local effects,which appear separately,either on one or the other. In September of 2015,we were finishing installingthe second-generation technologyin the detectors,and we still weren't at the optimalsensitivity that we wanted —we're still not, even now,two years later —but we wanted to gather data.We didn't think we'd see anything,but we were getting ready to startcollecting a few months' worth of data.And then nature surprised us. On September 14, 2015,we saw, in both detectors,a gravitational wave.In both detectors, we saw a signalwith cycles that increasedin amplitude and frequencyand then go back down.And they were the same in both detectors.They were gravitational waves.And not only that —in decoding this type of wave,we were able to deducethat they came from black holesfusing together to make one,more than a billion years ago.And that was —n(Applause) that was fantastic. At first, we couldn't believe it.We didn't imaginethis would happen until much later;it was a surprise for all of us.It took us months to convinceourselves that it was true,because we didn't want to leaveany room for error.But it was true, and to clear up any doubtthat the detectorsreally could measure these things,in December of that same year,we measured another gravitational wave,smaller than the first one.The first gravitational waveproduced a difference in the distanceof four-thousandths of a protonover four kilometers.Yes, the second detection was smaller,but still very convincingby our standards.Despite the fact that these are space-timewaves and not sound waves,we like to put them into loudspeakersand listen to them.We call this \"the music of the universe.\"I'd like you to listento the first two notes of that music. (Chirping sound) (Chirping sound)The second, shorter soundwas the last fraction of a secondof the two black holes which,in that fraction of a second,emitted vast amounts of energy —so much energy, it was like three Sunsconverting into energy,following that famous formula,E = mc2.Remember that one?We love this music so muchwe actually dance to it.I'm going to have you listen again. (Chirping sound) (Chirping sound)It's the music of the universe!n(Applause) People frequently ask me now:\"What can gravitational wavesbe used for?And now that you've discovered them,what else is there left to do?\"What can gravitational wavesbe used for? When they asked Borges,\"What is the purpose of poetry?\"he, in turn, answered,\"What's the purpose of dawn?What's the purpose of caresses?What's the purposeof the smell of coffee?\"He answered,\"The purpose of poetry is pleasure;it's for emotion, it's for living.\"nAnd understanding the universe,this human curiosity for knowinghow everything works,is similar.Since time immemorial, humanity —all of us, everyone, as kids —when we look up at the skyfor the first time and see the stars,we wonder,\"What are stars?\"That curiosity is what makes us human.And that's what we do with science. We like to say that gravitational wavesnow have a purpose,because we're opening upa new way to explore the universe.Until now, we were able to seethe light of the starsvia electromagnetic waves.Now we can listento the sound of the universe,even of things that don't emit light,like gravitational waves. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) But are they useful?Can't we derive any technologyfrom gravitational waves? Yes, probably.But it will probably take a lot of time.We've developedthe technology to detect them,but in terms of the waves themselves,maybe we'll discover 100 years from nowthat they are useful.But it takes a lot of timeto derive technology from science,and that's not why we do it.All technology is derived from science,but we practice science for the enjoyment.What's left to do?A lot.A lot; this is only the beginning. As we make the detectorsmore and more sensitive —and we have lots of work to do there —not only are we going to seemore black holesand be able to cataloghow many there are, where they areand how big they are,we'll also be able to see other objects.We'll see neutron stars fuseand turn into black holes.We'll see a black holes being born.We'll be able to seerotating stars in our galaxyproduce sinusoidal waves.We'll be able to seeexplosions of supernovas in our galaxy.We'll be seeinga whole spectrum of new sources. We like to saythat we've added a new senseto the human body:now, in addition to seeing,we're able to hear.This is a revolution in astronomy,like when Galileo invented the telescope.It's like when they added soundto silent movies.This is just the beginning.We like to thinkthat the road to science is very long —very fun, but very long —and that we, this large,international community of scientists,working from many countries,together as a team,are helping to build that road;that we're shedding light —sometimes encountering detours —and building, perhaps,a highway to the universe. Thank you. (Applause) More than 100 years after Albert Einstein predicted gravitational waves — ripples in space-time caused by violent cosmic collisions — LIGO scientists confirmed their existence using large, extremely precise detectors in Louisiana and Washington. Astrophysicist Gabriela González of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration tells us how this incredible, Nobel-winning discovery happened — and what it might mean for our understanding of the universe. (In Spanish with English subtitles.) Gabriela González is part of the collaboration of more than 1,000 scientists who measured for the first time the gravitational waves that Einstein predicted over 100 years ago.

3	"Today, more than halfof the world's population lives in cities.The urbanization processstarted in the late 1700sand has been increasing since then.The prediction is that by 2050,66 percent of the populationwill live in citiesand the United Nations,the World Health Organization,the World Economic Forum, are warning us,if we don't planfor the increased density,current problems in our cities,like inequality, congestion, crimecan only get worse.As a result, urban plannersand city developersare putting a lot of effort and creativityin designing our future,denser, bigger cities. But I have a different opinion.I think urbanization is actuallyreaching the end of its cycle,and now people are going to startmoving back to the countryside.And you may think,\"But what about the trend?\"Well, let me tell you,socioeconomic trends don't last forever.You know, 12,000 years agoeverybody was perfectly happyroaming the land, hunting and gathering.And then, the trend changes,and the new thingis to live in a farm and have cattle,until it changes again.When we get to the industrial revolution.Actually, that is what startedthe urbanization process.And you know what triggered it?Steam power, machines,new chemical processes —in two words, technological innovation.And I believe technologycan also bring the end of this cycle. I've been working on innovationfor most of my career.I love it. I love my job.It allows me to work with drones,with 3D printers and smart glasses,and not just those you can buy in the shopbut also prototypes.It's a lot of fun sometimes.Now, some of these technologiesare opening new possibilitiesthat will radically changethe way we did things beforeand in a few years,they may allow usto enjoy the benefits of city lifefrom anywhere.Think about it.If you could live in a placewith a lower crime rateand more spaceand a lower cost of livingand less traffic,of course many people would want that,but they feel they don't have a choice.You have to live in the city. Well, in the past,people moved to the citiesnot because they loved the city itselfbut for the thingsyou could have in a city,more job opportunities,easier access to services and goodsand a rich social life.So let's dive deeper. More jobs and career opportunities.Is that still true today,because the office peopleare starting to realizethat working in the officeand being in the officemay not be the same thing anymore.According to a studyby Global Workplace Analytics,more than 80 percent of the US workforcewould like to work from home.And do you know how much it costsfor a company to even have an office?11,000 dollars per employee per year.If only half of those workerswould teleworkeven 50 percent of the time,the savings in the stateswould exceed 500 billion dollars,and it could reduce greenhouse gasesby 54 million tons.That is the equivalentof 10 million carsoff the streets for a whole year.But even though most peoplewould want to telework,current technologymakes the experience isolating.It's not comfortable.It doesn't feel like being there.But that is going to changeby the convergence of two technologies:augmented reality and telepresence robots. Augmented reality already todayallows you to take your officeenvironment everywhere with you.All you need is a wearable computer,a pair of smart glasses,and you can take your emailsand your spreadsheetswith you wherever you go.And video conferences and video callshave become very common these days,but they still need improvement.I mean, all those little faceson a flat screen,sometimes you don'teven know who is talking. Now, we already have somethingway better than static videocalls:your average telepresence robot.I call it tablet on a stick. (Laughter) You can control, you can move around,you can control what you're looking at.It's way better, but far from perfect.You know how they saythat most humancommunication is nonverbal?Well, the robot doesn'tgive you any of that.It looks like an alien.But with advances in augmented reality,it will be easy to wrap the robotin a nice hologramthat actually looksand moves like a person.That will do it.Or else, forget the robot.We go full VR,and everybody meets in cyberspace.Give it a couple of yearsand that will feel so real,you won't tell the difference. So what was the next reasonwhy people move to cities?Access to services and goods.But today you can do all that online.According to a study made by comScore,online shoppers in the US last yeardid more than halfof their retail purchases online,and the global market for e-commerceis estimated to beat two trillion dollars.And it's expected to reach 2.38by the end of 2017,according to eMarketer. Now, from a logistics standpoint,density is good for deliveries.Supplying goodsto a shopping mall is easy.You can send big shipments to the shop,and people will go there, pick it upand take it home themselves.E-commerce means we need to ship onesiesand have them home delivered.That's more expensive.It's like the difference betweenhaving a birthday party for 20 peopleor bringing a piece of the caketo each of your 20 friends at their place.But at least in the city,they live close to each other.Density helps.Now, e-commerce deliveriesin the countryside,those take forever.The truck sometimes needs to drive milesbetween one address and the next one.Those are the most expensivedeliveries of all. But we already have a solution for that:drones.A vehicle carrying a squadron of drones.The driver does some of the deliverieswhile the drones are flyingback and forth from the truck as it moves.That way, the average costfor delivery is reduced,and voila:affordable e-commerce servicesin the countryside.You will see:the new homes of our teleworkerswill probably havea drone pod in the yard.So once the final mile deliveryis not a problem,you don't need to be in the cityto buy things anymore.So that's two. Now, what was the third reasonwhy people move to cities?A rich social life.They would need to bein the city for that these days.Because people these days,they make friends,they chat, gossip and flirtfrom the comfort of their sofa. (Laughter) And while wearing their favorite pajamas. (Laughter) There are over two billionactive social media users in the world.In a way, that makes you thinklike we are connectedno matter where we are.But OK, not completely.Sometimes you still needsome real human contact.Ironically, the city,with its population density,is not always the best for that.Actually, as social groups become smaller,they grow stronger.A recent study made in the UKby the Office for National Statisticsshowed a higher life satisfaction ratingamong people living in rural areas.So as people settle in the countryside,well, they will buy local groceries,fresh groceries, foodstuff,maintenance services.So handymen, small workshops,service companies will thrive.Maybe some of the industrialworkers from the citiesdisplaced by the automationwill find a nice alternative job here,and they will move too.And as people move to the countryside,how is that going to be?Think about autonomous,off-the-grid houses with solar panels,with wind turbinesand waste recycling utilities,our new homes producing their own energyand using it to also power the family car.I mean, cities have always been regardedas being more energy-efficient,but let me tell you,repopulating the countrysidecan be eco too. By now, you're probably thinkingof all the advantages of country living. (Laughter) I did it myself.Six years ago, my wife and I,we packed our stuff,we sold our little apartment in Spain,and for the same moneywe bought a house with a gardenand little birds that comesinging in the morning. (Laughter) It's so nice there.And we live in a small village,not really the countryside yet.That is going to be my next move:a refurbished farmhouse,not too far from a city, not too close.And now we'll make sureto have a good spot for drones to land. (Laughter) But hey, that's me.It doesn't have to be you,because it would seemlike I'm trying to convince somebodyto come join us in the country.I'm not. (Laughter) I don't need more people to come. (Laughter) I just think they willonce they realize they can havethe same benefits the city has.But if you don't like the country,I have good news for you, too.Cities will not disappear.But as people move out,a lower density will help themrecover a better flow and balance. Anyway, I guess nowyou have some thinking to do.Do you still thinkyou need to live in the city?And more importantly,do you want to? Thank you very much. (Applause) Don't believe predictions that say the future is trending towards city living. Urbanization is actually reaching the end of its cycle, says logistics expert Julio Gil, and soon more people will be choosing to live (and work) in the countryside, thanks to rapid advances in augmented reality, autonomous delivery, off-the-grid energy and other technologies. Think outside city walls and consider the advantages of country living with this forward-thinking talk. UPS's Julio Gil thinks that technology is flipping the equation on future cities, and that rural may soon become the new urban.

4	"In my early days as a graduate student,I went on a snorkeling tripoff the coast of the Bahamas.I'd actually never swumin the ocean before,so it was a bit terrifying.What I remember the most is,as I put my head in the waterand I was trying really hardto breathe through the snorkel,this huge groupof striped yellow and black fishcame straight at me ...and I just froze.And then, as if it hadsuddenly changed its mind,came towards meand then swerved to the rightand went right around me.It was absolutely mesmerizing.Maybe many of youhave had this experience.Of course, there's the colorand the beauty of it,but there was alsojust the sheer oneness of it,as if it wasn't hundreds of fishbut a single entitywith a single collective mindthat was making decisions.When I look back, I think that experiencereally ended up determiningwhat I've worked on for most of my career. I'm a computer scientist,and the field that I work inis artificial intelligence.And a key theme in AIis being able to understand intelligenceby creating our own computational systemsthat display intelligencethe way we see it in nature.Now, most popular views of AI, of course,come from science fiction and the movies,and I'm personally a big Star Wars fan.But that tends to be a very human-centricview of intelligence.When you think of a fish school,or when I think of a flock of starlings,that feels like a really differentkind of intelligence.For starters, any one fish is just so tinycompared to the sheer sizeof the collective,so it seems that any one individualwould have a really limitedand myopic view of what's going on,and intelligenceisn't really about the individualbut somehow a propertyof the group itself. Secondly, and the thingthat I still find most remarkable,is that we know that there are no leaderssupervising this fish school.Instead, this incrediblecollective mind behavioris emerging purely from the interactionsof one fish and another.Somehow, there are these interactionsor rules of engagementbetween neighboring fishthat make it all work out. So the question for AI then becomes,what are those rules of engagementthat lead to this kind of intelligence,and of course, can we create our own? And that's the primary thingthat I work on with my team in my lab.We work on it through theory,looking at abstract rule systemsand thinking aboutthe mathematics behind it.We also do it through biology,working closely with experimentalists.But mostly, we do it through robotics,where we try to createour own collective systemsthat can do the kinds of thingsthat we see in nature,or at least try to. One of our first robotic questsalong this linewas to create our very own colonyof a thousand robots.So very simple robots,but they could be programmedto exhibit collective intelligence,and that's what we were able to do.So this is what a single robot looks like.It's quite small,about the size of a quarter,and you can program how it moves,but it can also wirelesslycommunicate with other robots,and it can measure distances from them.And so now we can start to programexactly an interaction,a rule of engagement between neighbors.And once we have this system,we can start to program manydifferent kinds of rules of engagementthat you would see in nature. So for example,spontaneous synchronization,how audiences are clappingand suddenly start all clapping together,the fireflies flashing together.We can program rulesfor pattern formation,how cells in a tissuedetermine what rolethey're going to take onand set the patterns of our bodies.We can program rules for migration,and in this way, we're really learningfrom nature's rules. But we can also take it a step further.We can actually take these rulesthat we've learned from natureand combine them and createentirely new collective behaviorsof our very own. So for example,imagine that you hadtwo different kinds of rules.So your first rule is a motion rulewhere a moving robot can movearound other stationary robots.And your second rule is a pattern rulewhere a robot takes on a colorbased on its two nearest neighbors.So if I start with a blob of robotsin a little pattern seed,it turns out that these two rulesare sufficient for the groupto be able to self-assemblea simple line pattern.And if I have morecomplicated pattern rules,and I design error correction rules,we can actually create really,really complicated self assemblies,and here's what that looks like. So here, you're going to seea thousand robotsthat are working togetherto self-assemble the letter K.The K is on its side.And the important thingis that no one is in charge.So any single robot is only talkingto a small number of robots nearby it,and it's using its motion ruleto move around the half-built structurejust looking for a place to fit inbased on its pattern rules.And even though no robotis doing anything perfectly,the rules are such that we can getthe collective to do its goalrobustly together.And the illusion becomesalmost so perfect, you know —you just start to not even noticethat they're individual robots at all,and it becomes a single entity,kind of like the school of fish. So these are robots and rulesin two dimensions,but we can also think about robotsand rules in three dimensions.So what if we could create robotsthat could build together?And here, we can take inspirationfrom social insects.So if you think aboutmound-building termitesor you think about army ants,they create incredible,complex nest structures out of mudand even out of their own bodies.And like the system I showed you before,these insects actuallyalso have pattern rulesthat help them determine what to build,but the pattern can be madeout of other insects,or it could be made out of mud.And we can use that same ideato create rules for robots. So here, you're going to seesome simulated robots.So the simulated robot has a motion rule,which is how it traversesthrough the structure,looking for a place to fit in,and it has pattern ruleswhere it looks at groups of blocksto decide whether to place a block.And with the right motion rulesand the right pattern rules,we can actually get the robotsto build whatever we want.And of course, everybody wantstheir own tower. (Laughter) So once we have these rules,we can start to create the robot bodiesthat go with these rules.So here, you see a robotthat can climb over blocks,but it can also lift and move these blocksand it can start to editthe very structure that it's on.But with these rules,this is really only one kind of robot bodythat you could imagine.You could imaginemany different kinds of robot bodies.So if you think about robotsthat maybe could move sandbagsand could help build levees,or we could think of robotsthat built out of soft materialsand worked togetherto shore up a collapsed building —so just the same kind of rulesin different kinds of bodies.Or if, like my group, you are completelyobsessed with army ants,then maybe one day we can make robotsthat can climb over literally anythingincluding other members of their tribe,and self-assemble thingsout of their own bodies.Once you understand the rules,just many different kindsof robot visions become possible. And coming back to the snorkeling trip,we actually understand a great dealabout the rules that fish schools use.So if we can inventthe bodies to go with that,then maybe there is a futurewhere I and my group will get to snorkelwith a fish school of our own creation. Each of these systems that I showed youbrings us closer to havingthe mathematical and the conceptual toolsto create our own versionsof collective power,and this can enable many different kindsof future applications,whether you think about robotsthat build flood barriersor you think about robotic bee coloniesthat could pollinate cropsor underwater schools of robotsthat monitor coral reefs,or if we reach for the starsand we thinking about programmingconstellations of satellites.In each of these systems,being able to understandhow to design the rules of engagementand being able to creategood collective behaviorbecomes a key to realizing these visions. So, so far I've talked aboutrules for insects and for fishand for robots,but what about the rules that applyto our own human collective?And the last thoughtthat I'd like to leave you withis that science is of course itselfan incredible manifestationof collective intelligence,but unlike the beautifulfish schools that I study,I feel we still have a much longerevolutionary path to walk.So in addition to working on improvingthe science of robot collectives,I also work on creating robotsand thinking about rulesthat will improveour own scientific collective.There's this saying that I love:who does sciencedetermines what science gets done.Imagine a societywhere we had rules of engagementwhere every child grew up believingthat they could stand hereand be a technologist of the future,or where every adultbelieved that they had the abilitynot just to understand but to changehow science and technologyimpacts their everyday lives.What would that society look like?I believe that we can do that.I believe that we can choose our rules,and we engineer not just robotsbut we can engineerour own human collective,and if we do and when we do,it will be beautiful. Thank you. (Applause) Science fiction visions of the future show us AI built to replicate our way of thinking — but what if we modeled it instead on the other kinds of intelligence found in nature? Robotics engineer Radhika Nagpal studies the collective intelligence displayed by insects and fish schools, seeking to understand their rules of engagement. In a visionary talk, she presents her work creating artificial collective power and previews a future where swarms of robots work together to build flood barriers, pollinate crops, monitor coral reefs and form constellations of satellites. Taking cues from bottom-up biological networks like those of social insects, Radhika Nagpal helped design an unprecedented “swarm” of ant-like robots.

5	"I was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal,and through a combinationof accidents and cosmic justice,became a chef in the US. (Laughter) When I first arrived in New York,I began working in these restaurants —different types of restaurants —from French bistro to Italian,global ethnic to modern American.At the time,New York was already well-establishedas a food capital of the world.However ...with the exception of a few West Africanand Ethiopian mom-and-pop eateries,there was no such thingas African cuisine in the entire city. Early in my life,I was influencedby Senegal's first president,Léopold Sédar Senghor,nicknamed, \"the poet president,\"who talked about a new humanism,a universal civilization,in which all cultures would come togetheraround a communal table as equals,each bringing its own beautifulcontribution to share.He called it \"the rendezvousof giving and receiving.\"That concept resonated with me,and it has guided my career path. After years of working in restaurants,I yearned for my workto have a deeper impactthat would go beyondthe last meal I had served.I wanted to give back, both to New York —the city that allowed methe opportunity to follow my calling —but also to my originsand ancestors in Senegal.I wanted to contributeto that universal civilizationSenghor had described.But I didn't know how to makea measurable impactas a cook and writer. While I was writing my first cookbook,I often traveled to different regionsof Senegal for research.During one of those trips,in the remote, southeastregion of KédougouI rediscoveredan ancient grain called foniothat had all but disappearedfrom the urban Senegalese diet.It turns out that foniohad been cultivatedfor more than five thousand yearsand is probably the oldestcultivated cereal in Africa.Once a popular grainon much of the continent,fonio was grownall the way to ancient Egypt,where archaeologists found grainsinside pyramids' burial grounds.Today it is mostly cultivatedin the western part of the Sahel region,from Senegal to Mali,Burkina Faso,Togo, Nigeria.The Sahel region is that semiarid areasouth of the Sahara desertthat extends from the Atlanticin the west to the Red Sea in the east.I became more interested in this grainthat was deemed worth takingto the afterlife by early Egyptians. As I continued my research,I found out that fonio was actually —wherever it was cultivated —there was always some myth,or some superstition connected to it.The Dogon,another great culture in Mali,called it \"po,\"or, \"the seed of the universe.\"In that ancient culture's mythology,the entire universesprouted from a seed of fonio. Aside from its purportedmystical properties,fonio is a miracle grain in many aspects.It is nutritious,particularly richin methionine and cysteine,two amino acids that are deficientin most other major grains:barley, rice or wheat to name a few.In addition,fonio cultivationis great for the environment.It tolerates poor soiland needs very little water,surviving where nothing else will grow. As a chef,what first struck me wasits delicate taste and its versatility.Similar to couscous,fonio has a delicious,nutty and earthy flavor.It can be turned into salad,served as noodles,used in bakingor simply as a substitute for anyother grains in your favorite recipes.I am happy to share some of myfonio sushi and sweet potato sushiwith some of you right now. (Audience) Oh!n(Applause) And okra. (Audience murmurs) In Kédougouit is also nicknamed \"ñamu buur,\"which means \"food for royalty,\"and it's served for guests of honor. Located at the borderwith Guinea and Mali,Kédougou first strikes visitorswith its stunning vistasand views of the Fouta Djallon Mountains.Sadly, it is also one of the poorestregions of Senegal.Because of desertificationand lack of job prospects,much of Kédougou'syoung population has left.They chose the deadly path of migrationin search of \"better\" opportunities.Often,they risk their livestrying to reach Europe.Some leave by crossing the Sahara desert.Others end up on inadequate wooden canoesin desperate attempts to reach Spain.According to a recent \"Guardian\" article,by 2020 more that 60 million peoplefrom sub-Saharan Africaare expected to migratedue to desertification.This is the biggest global waveof migration since the Second World War,and it's only set to grow.So far this year,more that 2,100 migrantshave lost their liveson their way to Europe.This is the reality of Kédougouand of much of the Sahel today.Scary future,scarce foodand no opportunitiesto change their situation. If life in your villageweren't so precarious,if there was a wayto having enough food to get by,or having a paying job —if you and your sistersdidn't have to spend30 percent of their waking hoursfetching water,if conditions were justa little more hospitable ...could the solutionbe right here in our soil?Could bringing fonioto the rest of the worldbe the answer? Ancient grains are getting more popular,and sales of gluten-free itemsare growing in the US —16.4 percent since 2013,making it a 23.3-billion-dollar industry.How could foniopartake in this market share? There are many challengesin turning fonio into food.Traditional processingis laborious and time-consuming,especially when compared to other grains.Well, thankfully, technology has evolved.And there are now machinesthat can process fonioin a more efficient way.And as a matter of fact,a few years ago,Sanoussi Diakité,a Senegalese engineer,won a Rolex prizefor his invention of the firstmechanized fonio processor.Today, such machines are making lifemuch easier for producersaround the whole Sahel region. Another challengeis the colonial mentalitythat what comes from the west is best.This tendency to look downon our own productsand to see crops like fonioas simply \"country peoples' food,\"therefore substandard,explains why even though we don'tproduce wheat in Senegal traditionally,it is far easier to find baguettesor croissants in the streets of Dakarthan it is to find any fonio products.This same mindset popularizedthe overprocessed, leftover rice debrisknown as \"broken rice,\"which was imported to Senegalfrom Indochinaand introduced by the colonial French.Soon, broken rice becamea key ingredient in our national dish,thiéboudienne,replacing our own traditional,more nutritious African rice,Oryza glaberrima.Ironically, the same African ricedespised at homewas hailed abroad.Indeed, during the Atlantic slave trade,this rice becamea major crop in the Americas ...particularly in the Carolinaswhere it was nicknamed, \"Carolina gold.\"nBut let's return to fonio.How can we turn its current statusof \"country-people food\"into a world-class crop?Last year,a business partner and I secureda commitment from Whole Foods Market,the US's largest natural food store chain,to carry fonio.And we got a largeAmerican ingredient importerinterested enoughto send a team of executivesto West Africa with usto explore the supply chain's viability.We found ourselvesobserving manual operationsin remote locationswith few controls over quality.So we started focusingon processing issues.We drew up a visionwith a beneficial and commerciallysustainable supply chain for fonio,and we connected ourselveswith organizationsthat can help us achieve it. Walking backwards from the market,here is what it looks like.Imagine that foniois consumed all across the globeas other popular ancient grains.Fonio touted on the levels of cereals,breads,nutrition bars,cookies, pastas,snacks — why not?It's easier to say than quinoa. (Laughter) (Applause) To get there,fonio needs to be readily availableat a consistent qualityfor commercial users,such as food manufacturersand restaurant chains.That's the part we're missing.To make fonio availableat a consistent qualityfor commercial use,you need a commercial-scale fonio millthat adheres to internationalquality standards.Currently, there is no such millin the whole world,so in our vision,there is an African-ownedand operated fonio millthat processes efficientlyand in compliance with the requirementsof multinational food companies.It is very difficultfor the fonio producers todayto sell and use foniounless they devotea huge amount of time and energyin threshing, winnowing and husking it.In our vision,the mill will take on those tasks,allowing the producers to focuson farming rather than processing. There is untappedagricultural capacity in the Sahel,and all it takesis changing market conditionsto activate that capacity.By relieving fonio producersof manual operations,the mill will free up their timeand remove the production bottleneckthat limits their output.And there are other benefits as wellin using Sahel land for agriculture.More benefits,higher employment,climate change mitigationby reversing desertificationand greater food security.Nice vision, right?Well, we are workingtowards getting it done.Last month we introduced fonioto shoppers in New York Cityand online,in a package that makes it attractiveand desirable and accessible. (Applause) We are talking with operatorsand investors in West Africaabout building a fonio mill.And most importantly,we have teamed with an NGOcalled SOS SAHELto recruit, train and equipsmallholders in the Sahelto increase their fonio production. Hunger levels are higherin sub-Saharan Africathan any other place in the world.The Sahel population is set to growfrom 135 million to 340 million people.However, in that drought-and famine-prone region,fonio grows freely.This tiny grain may provide big answers,reasserting its Dogon name,\"po,\" the seed of the universe,and taking us one step closerto the universal civilization. Thank you. (Applause) Forget quinoa. Meet fonio, an ancient \"miracle grain\" native to Senegal that's versatile, nutritious and gluten-free.

7	"Whether you like it or not,radical transparency and algorithmicdecision-making is coming at you fast,and it's going to change your life.That's because it's now easyto take algorithmsand embed them into computersand gather all that datathat you're leaving on yourselfall over the place,and know what you're like,and then direct the computersto interact with youin ways that are betterthan most people can. Well, that might sound scary.I've been doing this for a long timeand I have found it to be wonderful.My objective has beento have meaningful workand meaningful relationshipswith the people I work with,and I've learned that I couldn't have thatunless I had that radical transparencyand that algorithmic decision-making.I want to show you why that is,I want to show you how it works.And I warn you that some of the thingsthat I'm going to show youprobably are a little bit shocking. Since I was a kid,I've had a terrible rote memory.And I didn't like following instructions,I was no good at following instructions.But I loved to figure outhow things worked for myself.When I was 12,I hated school but I fell in lovewith trading the markets.I caddied at the time,earned about five dollars a bag.And I took my caddying money,and I put it in the stock market.And that was just becausethe stock market was hot at the time.And the first company I boughtwas a company by the nameof Northeast Airlines.Northeast Airlines wasthe only company I heard ofthat was selling for lessthan five dollars a share. (Laughter) And I figured I could buy more shares,and if it went up, I'd make more money.So, it was a dumb strategy, right?But I tripled my money,and I tripled my moneybecause I got lucky.The company was about to go bankrupt,but some other company acquired it,and I tripled my money.And I was hooked.And I thought, \"This game is easy.\"With time,I learned this game is anything but easy. In order to be an effective investor,one has to bet against the consensusand be right.And it's not easy to betagainst the consensus and be right.One has to bet againstthe consensus and be rightbecause the consensusis built into the price.And in order to be an entrepreneur,a successful entrepreneur,one has to bet againstthe consensus and be right.I had to be an entrepreneurand an investor —and what goes along with thatis making a lot of painful mistakes.So I made a lot of painful mistakes,and with time,my attitude about those mistakesbegan to change.I began to think of them as puzzles.That if I could solve the puzzles,they would give me gems.And the puzzles were:What would I do differently in the futureso I wouldn't make that painful mistake?And the gems were principlesthat I would then write downso I would remember themthat would help me in the future.And because I wrote them down so clearly,I could then —eventually discovered —I could then embed them into algorithms.And those algorithmswould be embedded in computers,and the computers wouldmake decisions along with me;and so in parallel,we would make these decisions.And I could see how those decisionsthen compared with my own decisions,and I could see thatthose decisions were a lot better.And that was because the computercould make decisions much faster,it could process a lot more informationand it can process decisions much more —less emotionally.So it radically improvedmy decision-making. Eight years after I started Bridgewater,I had my greatest failure,my greatest mistake.It was late 1970s,I was 34 years old,and I had calculated that American bankshad lent much more moneyto emerging countriesthan those countrieswere going to be able to pay backand that we would havethe greatest debt crisissince the Great Depression.And with it, an economic crisisand a big bear market in stocks.It was a controversial view at the time.People thought it waskind of a crazy point of view.But in August 1982,Mexico defaulted on its debt,and a number of other countries followed.And we had the greatest debt crisissince the Great Depression.And because I had anticipated that,I was asked to testify to Congressand appear on \"Wall Street Week,\"which was the show of the time.Just to give you a flavor of that,I've got a clip here,and you'll see me in there. (Video) Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mitchell,it's a great pleasure and a great honorto be able to appear before youin examination with whatis going wrong with our economy.The economy is now flat —teetering on the brink of failure. Martin Zweig: You were recentlyquoted in an article.You said, \"I can say thiswith absolute certaintybecause I know how markets work.\"nRay Dalio: I can saywith absolute certaintythat if you look at the liquidity basein the corporationsand the world as a whole,that there's such reducedlevel of liquiditythat you can't returnto an era of stagflation.\"nI look at that now, I think,\"What an arrogant jerk!\"n(Laughter) I was so arrogant, and I was so wrong.I mean, while the debt crisis happened,the stock market and the economywent up rather than going down,and I lost so much moneyfor myself and for my clientsthat I had to shut downmy operation pretty much,I had to let almost everybody go.And these were like extended family,I was heartbroken.And I had lost so much moneythat I had to borrow4,000 dollars from my dadto help to pay my family bills. It was one of the most painfulexperiences of my life ...but it turned out to beone of the greatest experiences of my lifebecause it changed my attitudeabout decision-making.Rather than thinking, \"I'm right,\"I started to ask myself,\"How do I know I'm right?\"I gained a humility that I neededin order to balance my audacity.I wanted to find the smartestpeople who would disagree with meto try to understand their perspectiveor to have themstress test my perspective.I wanted to make an idea meritocracy.In other words,not an autocracy in whichI would lead and others would followand not a democracy in which everybody'spoints of view were equally valued,but I wanted to have an idea meritocracyin which the best ideas would win out.And in order to do that,I realized that we would needradical truthfulnessand radical transparency. What I mean by radical truthfulnessand radical transparencyis people needed to saywhat they really believedand to see everything.And we literallytape almost all conversationsand let everybody see everything,because if we didn't do that,we couldn't really havean idea meritocracy.In order to have an idea meritocracy,we have let people speakand say what they want.Just to give you an example,this is an email from Jim Haskel —somebody who works for me —and this was availableto everybody in the company.\"Ray, you deserve a 'D-'for your performancetoday in the meeting ...you did not prepare at all wellbecause there is no wayyou could have been that disorganized.\"Isn't that great? (Laughter) That's great.It's great because, first of all,I needed feedback like that.I need feedback like that.And it's great because if I don't let Jim,and people like Jim,to express their points of view,our relationship wouldn't be the same.And if I didn't make that publicfor everybody to see,we wouldn't have an idea meritocracy. So for that last 25 yearsthat's how we've been operating.We've been operatingwith this radical transparencyand then collecting these principles,largely from making mistakes,and then embeddingthose principles into algorithms.And then those algorithms provide —we're following the algorithmsin parallel with our thinking.That has been how we've runthe investment business,and it's how we also dealwith the people management. In order to give you a glimmerinto what this looks like,I'd like to take you into a meetingand introduce you to a tool of ourscalled the \"Dot Collector\"that helps us do this.A week after the US election,our research team held a meetingto discuss what a Trump presidencywould mean for the US economy.Naturally, people haddifferent opinions on the matterand how we wereapproaching the discussion.The \"Dot Collector\" collects these views.It has a list of a few dozen attributes,so whenever somebody thinks somethingabout another person's thinking,it's easy for themto convey their assessment;they simply note the attributeand provide a rating from one to 10.For example, as the meeting began,a researcher named Jen rated me a three —in other words, badly —n(Laughter) for not showing a good balanceof open-mindedness and assertiveness.As the meeting transpired,Jen's assessments of peopleadded up like this.Others in the roomhave different opinions.That's normal.Different people are alwaysgoing to have different opinions.And who knows who's right?Let's look at just what people thoughtabout how I was doing.Some people thought I did well,others, poorly.With each of these views,we can explore the thinkingbehind the numbers.Here's what Jen and Larry said.Note that everyonegets to express their thinking,including their critical thinking,regardless of their positionin the company.Jen, who's 24 years oldand right out of college,can tell me, the CEO,that I'm approaching things terribly. This tool helps peopleboth express their opinionsand then separate themselvesfrom their opinionsto see things from a higher level.When Jen and others shift their attentionsfrom inputting their own opinionsto looking down on the whole screen,their perspective changes.They see their own opinionsas just one of manyand naturally start asking themselves,\"How do I know my opinion is right?\"That shift in perspective is like goingfrom seeing in one dimensionto seeing in multiple dimensions.And it shifts the conversationfrom arguing over our opinionsto figuring out objective criteriafor determining which opinions are best. Behind the \"Dot Collector\"is a computer that is watching.It watches what allthese people are thinkingand it correlates thatwith how they think.And it communicates adviceback to each of them based on that.Then it draws the datafrom all the meetingsto create a pointilist paintingof what people are likeand how they think.And it does that guided by algorithms.Knowing what people are like helpsto match them better with their jobs.For example,a creative thinker who is unreliablemight be matched up with someonewho's reliable but not creative.Knowing what people are likealso allows us to decidewhat responsibilities to give themand to weigh our decisionsbased on people's merits.We call it their believability.Here's an example of a vote that we tookwhere the majorityof people felt one way ...but when we weighed the viewsbased on people's merits,the answer was completely different.This process allows us to make decisionsnot based on democracy,not based on autocracy,but based on algorithms that takepeople's believability into consideration. Yup, we really do this. (Laughter) We do it because it eliminateswhat I believe to beone of the greatest tragedies of mankind,and that is people arrogantly,naïvely holding opinionsin their minds that are wrong,and acting on them,and not putting them out thereto stress test them.And that's a tragedy.And we do it because it elevates ourselvesabove our own opinionsso that we start to see thingsthrough everybody's eyes,and we see things collectively.Collective decision-making is so muchbetter than individual decision-makingif it's done well.It's been the secret saucebehind our success.It's why we've mademore money for our clientsthan any other hedge fund in existenceand made money23 out of the last 26 years. So what's the problemwith being radically truthfuland radically transparent with each other?People say it's emotionally difficult.Critics say it's a formulafor a brutal work environment.Neuroscientists tell me it has to dowith how are brains are prewired.There's a part of our brainthat would like to know our mistakesand like to look at our weaknessesso we could do better.I'm told that that'sthe prefrontal cortex.And then there's a part of our brainwhich views all of this as attacks.I'm told that that's the amygdala.In other words,there are two you's inside you:there's an emotional youand there's an intellectual you,and often they're at odds,and often they work against you.It's been our experiencethat we can win this battle.We win it as a group.It takes about 18 months typicallyto find that most peopleprefer operating this way,with this radical transparencythan to be operatingin a more opaque environment.There's not politics,there's not the brutality of —you know, all of that hidden,behind-the-scenes —there's an idea meritocracywhere people can speak up.And that's been great.It's given us more effective work,and it's given usmore effective relationships.But it's not for everybody.We found something like25 or 30 percent of the populationit's just not for.And by the way,when I say radical transparency,I'm not saying transparencyabout everything.I mean, you don't have to tell somebodythat their bald spot is growingor their baby's ugly.So, I'm just talking about —n(Laughter) talking about the important things.So —n(Laughter) So when you leave this room,I'd like you to observe yourselfin conversations with others.Imagine if you knewwhat they were really thinking,and imagine if you knewwhat they were really like ...and imagine if they knewwhat you were really thinkingand what were really like.It would certainly clear things up a lotand make your operationstogether more effective.I think it will improveyour relationships.Now imagine that you can have algorithmsthat will help you gatherall of that informationand even help you make decisionsin an idea-meritocratic way.This sort of radical transparencyis coming at youand it is going to affect your life.And in my opinion,it's going to be wonderful.So I hope it is as wonderful for youas it is for me. Thank you very much. (Applause) What if you knew what your coworkers really thought about you and what they were really like?

8	"Do you rememberthese glow-in-the-dark little starswhich you had on the ceilingwhen you were a boy or a girl?Yes?It is light.It is pure light.I think I stared at them way too longwhen I was a five-year-old, you know?It's so beautiful:no energy bill, no maintenance.It is there. So two years ago, we went back to the lab,making it more durable,more light-emitting,with the experts.And at the same time,we got a request from this guy —Van Gogh, the famousVan Gogh Foundation —who wanted to celebratehis 125th anniversary in the Netherlands.And they came to me and asked,\"Can you make a placewhere he feels more alive againin the Netherlands?\"And I liked that question a lot,so in way,we sort of started to connectthese two different worlds.This is how my brain works,by the way. (Laughter) I would love to keep ondoing this for an hour,but OK —n(Laughter) And this is the result that we made:a bicycle path which chargesat daytime via the sunand glows at night, up to eight hours. (Applause) Thank you. ... hinting towards a futurewhich should be energy friendlyand linking up the local groundsas Van Gogh literally walkedand lived there in 1883.And you can go there every nightfor free, no ticket needed.People experience the beautyof cycling through the starry night,thinking about green energy and safety. I want to create placeswhere people feel connected again.And it was somehow greatto make these projects happenwith the industry,with the infrastructure companies.So when these sheikhs of Qatarstarted to call:\"How much for 10 kilometers?\"n(Laughter) Yeah, really, that's a weird callyou're going to get.But it's fascinatingthat this is not just a sortof one-off, nice-to-have special.I think this kind of creative thinking,these kinds of connections —it's the new economy. The World Economic Forum,the think tank in Geneva,did an interviewwith a lot of smart peopleall around the world,asking, \"What are the top 10 skillsyou and I need to become successful?\"And what is interesting,what you see here:it's not about moneyor being really good in C++,although these are great skillsto have, I have to admit.But look at number three, creativity;number two, critical thinking;number one, complex problem-solving —all the things a robot or a computeris really bad at.And this makes me very optimistic,very hopeful for the new world,that as we will livein this hyper-technological world,our human skills —our desire for empathy,our desire for curiosity,our desire for beauty —will be more appreciated again,and we will live in a worldwhere creativity is our true capital. And a creative process like that —I don't know how it works for you,but in my brain, it always startswith a question:Why?Why does a jellyfish emit light?Or a firefly?Or why do be accept pollution?This is from my roomin Beijing three years ago.Left image is a good day — Saturday.I can see the carsand the people, the birds;life is OK in a dense urban city.And on the right image —holy moly.Pollution — complete layers.I couldn't even seethe other side of the city.And this image made me really sad.This is not the bright futurewe envision here at TED —this is the horror.We live five to six years shorter;children have lung cancerwhen they're six years old.And so in a weird, beautiful way,I, at that moment, became inspiredby Beijing smog. And the governments all around the worldare fighting their war on smog,but I wanted to make somethingwithin the now.So we decided to buildthe largest smog vacuum cleanerin the world.It sucks up polluted air, cleans itand then releases it.And we built the first one.So it sucks up 30,000cubic meters per hour,cleans it on the nano level —the PM2.5, PM10 particles —using very little electricity,and then releases the clean air,so we have parks, playgrounds,which are 55 to 75 percent more cleanthan the rest of the city. (Applause) Yes!n(Applause) And every month or so,it opens like a spaceship —like a Marilyn Monroe with the —well, you know what.Anyway. (Laughter) So this ...this is the stuff we are capturing.This is Beijing smog.This is in our lungs right now.If you live next to a highway,it's the same as 17 cigarettes per day.Are we insane?When did we say yes to that?And we had bucketsof this disgusting materialin our studio,and on a Monday morning,we were discussing, we were like,\"Shit, what should we do with it?Should we throw it away?\"Like, \"Help!\"And then we realized:no, no, no, no, no —waste should not exist.Waste for the one should befood for the other.So, here, maybe show it around.Do not put this in your coffee. (Laughter) And we realized that 42 percentis made out of carbon,and carbon, of course,under high pressure,you get ...diamonds.So, inspired by that,we compress it for 30 minutes —n(Cracking sound) and make smog-free rings. (Laughter) And so by sharing — yeah, really!And so by sharing a ring,you donate 1,000 cubic meters of clean airto the city the tower is in. (Applause) I have one here —n(Applause) A little floating cube.I will give one to you.I'm not going to propose, don't worry. (Laughter) Are we good?You can show it around. And we put this online —Kickstarter campaign, crowdfunding.And people started to preorder it,but more importantly,they started to prepay it.So the finance we made with the jewelryhelped us to realize,to build the first tower.And that's powerful.So the waste the activator,it was the enabler.Also, the feedback from the community —this is a wedding couple from India,where he proposed to herwith the smog-free ringas a sign of true beauty,as a sign of hope.And she said yes. (Laughter) I love this image so muchfor a lot of different reasons. (Laughter) And right now, the projectis touring through China,actually with the supportof China's central government.So the first goal is to createlocal clean-air parks,and that works already quite well —55, 75 percent more clean.And at the same time,we team up with the NGOs,with the governors,with the students,with the tech people,to say, \"Hey, what do we need to doto make a whole city smog-free?\"It's about the dream of clean air.We do workshops. New ideas pop up.These are smog-free bicycleswhich — I'm Dutch, yes? —I have this \"bicycle DNA\"inside of me somewhere.And so it sucks up polluted air,it cleans it and releases it,in the fight against the car,in the celebration of the bicycle. And so right now, we're workingon a sort of \"package deal,\" so to speak,where we say, \"Smog-free towers,smog-free rings.\"We go to the mayorsor the governors of this world,and say, \"We can guaranteea short-term reduction of pollutionbetween 20 and 40 percent.Please sign here right now.\"Yes? (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) So it's all about connectingnew technology with creative thinking.And if you start thinking about that,there is so much you can imagine,so much more you can do.We worked on dance floorswhich produce electricitywhen you dance on them.We did the design for that — 2008.So it moves eight or nine millimeters,produces 25 watts.The electricity that we generateis used for the lighting or the DJ booth.So some of the sustainabilityis about doing more,not about doing less. But also on a larger scale,the Netherlands, where I'mfrom, we live below sea level.So because of these beauties —the Afsluitdijk: 32 kilometers,built by hand in 1932 —we live with the water,we fight with the water,we try to find harmony,but sometimes we forget.And therefore, we made \"Waterlicht,\"a combination of LEDs and lenses,which show how highthe water level would be —global change —if we stop.If, today, we all go home and we say,\"Oh, whatever, somebody elsewill do it for us,\"or we'll wait for government or whomever.You know, we're not going to do that.It goes wrong.And we placed this in public spacesall around the world.Thousands of people showed up. (Applause) Thank you.You're too nice, you're too nice.That's not good for a designer. So thousands of people showed up,and some, actually, were scared.And they left; they experiencedthe floods in 1953.And others were mesmerized.Can we make floating cities?Can we generate electricityfrom the change in tides?So I think it's so importantto make experiences —collective experiences —where people feel connectedwith a vision, with a futureand trigger what is possible. At the same time,you know, these kinds of things —they're not easy, yes?It's a struggle.And what I experienced in my lifeis that a lot of people saythey want innovation,and they want the nextand the new, the future.But the moment you present a new idea,there's this weird tendencyto reply to every new ideastarting with two words.Which are? (Audience guesses) No, not \"How much?\" It's more annoying. (Laughter) What is it, guys?Or you're really blessed people?That's really good. \"Yes, but.\" Very good.\"Yes, but: it's too expensive, it's toocheap, it's too fast, it's too slow,it's too beautiful, it's too ugly,it cannot be done, it already exists.\"I heard everything about the same projectin the same week.And I got really, really annoyed.I got a bit of gray hair, started to dressin black like a true architect. (Laughter) And one morning I woke upand I said, \"Daan, stop.This is dragging you down.You have to do something with this.You have to use itas an ingredient, as a component.\"And so we decided to build,to realize the famous \"Yes, but\" chair. (Laughter) And this is an existing chairby Friso Kramer, a Dutch design.But we gave it a little \"update,\"a little \"hack,\" so to speak.We placed a little voice-recognitionelement right here.So the moment you sit on that chair,and you say those two horrible,creative-destructive,annoying little words —n(Laughter) you get a short —n(Laughter) but pretty intenselittle shock on the back sideof your bottom. (Laughter) (Applause) And —n(Applause) and that works; yeah, that works.Some clients have left us,they got really mad.Fortunately, the good ones have stayed.And, of course, we alsoapply it to ourselves. But ladies and gentlemen,let's not be afraid.Let's be curious, yes?And, you know, walkingthrough TED in these daysand hearing the other speakersand feeling the energy of the crowd,I was remembering this quoteof the Canadian author, Marshall McLuhan,who once famously said,\"On spacecraft earth,there are no passengers.We are all crew.\"And I think this so beautiful.This is so beautiful!We're not just consumers; we're makers:we make decisions,we make new inventions,we make new dreams.And I thinkif we start implementingthat kind of thinking even morewithin today,there's still a whole new worldto be explored. All right, thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Daan Roosegaarde uses technology and creative thinking to produce imaginative, earth-friendly designs.

9	"Someday, we may have robotsas smart as people,artificial intelligence, AI.How could that happen?One route is that we'll just keepaccumulating better software,like we've been doing for 70 years.At past rates of progress,that may take centuries.Some say it'll happen a lot fasteras we discover grand newpowerful theories of intelligence.I'm skeptical. But a third scenariois what I'm going to talk about today.The idea is to port the softwarefrom the human brain.To do this, we're going to needthree technologies to be good enough,and none of them are there yet.First, we're going to needlots of cheap, fast, parallel computers.Second, we're going to needto scan individual human brainsin fine spatial and chemical detail,to see exactly what cells are where,connected to what, of what type.And third, we're going to needcomputer modelsof how each kind of brain cell works —taking input signals,changing interval stateand sending output signals.If we have good enough modelsof all the kinds of brain cellsand a good enough model of the brain,we can put it together to makea good enough model of an entire brain,and that model would have the sameinput-output behavior as the original.So if you talk to it, it might talk back.If you ask it to do things,it might do them.And if we could do that,everything would change. People have been talkingabout this idea for decades,under the name of \"uploads.\"I'm going to call them \"ems.\"When they talk about it, they say,\"Is this even possible?If you made one, would it be conscious?Or is it just an empty machine?If you made one of me,is that me or someone else?\"These are all fascinating questionsthat I'm going to ignore ... (Laughter) because I see a neglected question:What would actually happen?I became obsessed with this question.I spent four years trying to analyze it,using standard academic tools,to guess what would happen,and I'm here to tell you what I found.But be warned —I'm not offering inspiration,I'm offering analysis.I see my job as telling youwhat's most likely to happenif we did the least to avoid it.If you aren't at least a bit disturbedby something I tell you here,you're just not paying attention. (Laughter) OK, the first thing I can tell youis that ems spend mostof their life in virtual reality.This is what you might look likeif you were using virtual reality.And this is what you might see:sunlight glinting off of water,you might hear gulls flying above,you might even feel the windon your cheeks or smell seawater,with advanced hardware.Now, if you were to spenda lot of time here,you might want a dashboardwhere you could do things likemake a phone call,move to a new virtual world,check your bank account. Now, while this is whatyou would look like in virtual reality,this is what an emwould look like in virtual reality.It's computer hardwaresitting in a server rack somewhere.But still, it could seeand experience the same thing.But some things are different for ems.First, while you'll probably always noticethat virtual reality isn't entirely real,to an em, it can feel as real to themas this room feels to you nowor as anything ever feels.And ems also havesome more action possibilities. For example, your mind just alwaysruns at the same speed,but an em can add more or lesscomputer hardware to run faster or slower,and therefore, if the world around themseems to be going too fast,they can just speed up their mind,and the world around themwould seem to slow down. In addition, an em can makea copy of itself at that moment.This copy would remembereverything the same,and if it starts out with the same speed,looking at the same speed,it might even need to be told,\"You are the copy.\"And em could make archive copies,and with enough archives,an em can be immortal —in principle, though notusually in practice.And an em can move its brain,the computer that represents its brain,from one physical location to another.Ems can actually move around the worldat the speed of light,and by moving to a new location,they can interact more quicklywith ems near that new location. So far, I've been talking aboutwhat ems can do.What do ems choose to do?To understand that, we'll needto understand three key facts.First, ems by definition do whatthe human they emulate would doin the same situation.So their lives and behaviorare very human.They're mainly different becausethey're living in a different world.Second, ems needreal resources to survive.You need food and shelter or you'll die.Also, ems need computer hardware,energy, cooling, or they can't exist.For every subjective minutethat an em experiences,someone, usually that em,had to work to pay for it.Third, ems are poor. (Laughter) The em population can growquicker than the em economy,so that means wages fall downto em subsistence levels.That means ems have to be workingmost of the time.So that meansthis is what ems usually see:beautiful and luxurious, but desks —they're working most of the time.Now, a subsistence wage scenario,you might think, is exotic and strange,but it's actually the usual casein human history,and it's how pretty muchall wild animals have ever lived,so we know what humans doin this situation.Humans basically dowhat it takes to survive,and this is what lets me sayso much about the em world.When creatures are rich, like you,you have to know a lotabout what they wantto figure out what they do.When creatures are poor,you know that they mostly dowhat it takes to survive. So we've been talking about the em worldfrom the point of view of the ems —now, let's step backand look at their whole world.First, the em world growsmuch faster than ours,roughly a hundred times faster.So the amount of changewe would experience in a century or two,they would experience in a year or two.And I'm not really willing to projectthis age much beyond that,because plausibly by then something elsewill happen, I don't know what.Second, the typical emulationruns even faster,roughly a thousand times human speed.So for them, they experiencethousands of years in this year or two,and for them, the world around themis actually changing more slowlythan your world seems to change for you.Third, ems are crammed togetherin a small number of very dense cities.This is not only how they seethemselves in virtual reality,it's also how they actually arephysically crammed together.So at em speeds, physical travelfeels really painfully slow,so most em cities are self-sufficient,most war is cyber war,and most of the rest of the earthaway from the em citiesis left to the humans, because the emsreally aren't that interested in it. Speaking of humans,you were wanting to hear about that.Humans must retire, at once, for good.They just can't compete.Now, humans start out owningall of the capital in this world.The economy grows very fast,their wealth grows very fast.Humans get rich, collectively.As you may know, most humans todaydon't actually own that muchbesides their ability to work,so between now and then,they need to acquire sufficient assets,insurance or sharing arrangements,or they may starve.I highly recommend avoiding this outcome. (Laughter) Now, you might wonder,why would ems let humans exist?Why not kill them, take their stuff?But notice we have manyunproductive retirees around us today,and we don't kill themand take their stuff. (Laughter) In part, that's because it would disruptthe institutions we share with them.Other groups would wonder who's next,so plausibly, ems may well let humansretire in peace during the age of em.You should worry more thatthe age of em only lasts a year or twoand you don't know what happens next. Ems are very much like humans,but they are not like the typical human.The typical em is a copyof the few hundred most productive humans.So in fact, they are as elite,compared to the typical human,as the typical billionaire,Nobel Prize winner,Olympic gold medalist, head of state.Ems look on humansperhaps with nostalgia and gratitude,but not so much respect,which is, if you think about it,how you think about your ancestors.We know many things about how humansdiffer in terms of productivity.We can just use thoseto predict features of ems —for example, they tend to be smart,conscientious, hard-working,married, religious, middle-aged.These are features of ems. Em world also contains enormous variety.Not only does it continue on with mostof the kinds of variety that humans do,including variety of industryand profession,they also have many new kinds of variety,and one of the most importantis mind speed.Ems can plausibly go from human speedup to a million timesfaster than human speed,and down to a billion timesslower than human speed.Faster ems tend to havemarkers of high status.They embody more wealth.They win arguments.They sit at premium locations.Slower ems are mostly retirees,and they are like the ghostsof our literature.If you recall, ghosts are all around us —you can interact with themif you pay the price.But they don't know much,they can't influence much,and they're obsessed with the past,so what's the point? (Laughter) Ems also have more varietyin the structure of their lives.This is your life: you startand you end, really simple.This is the life of an em,who every day splits offsome short-term copiesto do short-term tasks and then end.We'll talk more aboutthose short term versions in a moment,but they are much more efficientbecause they don't have to restfor the next day.This em is more opportunistic.They make more copies of themselveswhen there's more demand for that.They don't know which waythe future's going. This is an em designer,who conceives of a large systemand then breaks recursively into copieswho elaborate that,so ems can implementlarger, more coherent designs.This an emulation plumberwho remembers that every day,for the last 20 years,they only ever workedtwo hours a day, a life of leisure.But what really happened is,every day they had a thousand copies,each of whom did a two-hour plumbing job,and only one of themwent on to the next day.Objectively, they're workingwell over 99 percent of the time.Subjectively, they remembera life of leisure. (Laughter) This, again, is you.You start and you end.This could be youif at the start of party,you took a drug that meantyou would not remember that partyever after that day.Some people do this, I'm told.Toward the end of the party,will you say to yourself,\"I'm about to die, this is terrible.That person tomorrow isn't me,because they won't remember what I do.\"Or you could say, \"I will go on tomorrow.I just won't remember what I did.\"This is an em who splits offa short-term copyto do a short-term task and then end.They have the same twoattitude possibilities.They can say, \"I'm a new short-termcreature with a short life. I hate this.\"Or \"I'm a part of a larger creaturewho won't remember this part.\"I predict they'll havethat second attitude,not because it's philosophically correct,but because it helps them get along. Today, if the president sayswe must invade Iraq,and you say, \"Why?\"and they say, \"State secret,\"you're not sure if you can trust them,but for ems, a copy of the presidentand a copy of you can go inside a safe,explain all their secret reasons,and then one bit comes outfrom your copy to yourself,telling you if you were convinced.So now you can knowthere is a good reason. I know you guys are all eagerto evaluate this world.You're eager to decideif you love it or hate it.But think: your ancestorsfrom thousands of years agowould have loved or hated your worldbased on the first few thingsthey heard about it,because your worldis really just weird.So before judging a strange future world,you should really learn a lot about it,maybe read a whole book about it,and then, if you don't like it,work to change it. Thank you. (Applause) Meet the \"ems\" — machines that emulate human brains and can think, feel and work just like the brains they're copied from. Futurist and social scientist Robin Hanson describes a possible future when ems take over the global economy, running on superfast computers and copying themselves to multitask, leaving humans with only one choice: to retire, forever. Glimpse a strange future as Hanson describes what could happen if robots ruled the earth. Does humanity have a future as uploaded minds? In his work, Robin Hanson asks this and other extra-large questions. Does humanity have a future as uploaded minds? In his work, Robin Hanson asks this and other extra-large questions."
10	"Today I'm going to talkabout technology and society.The Department of Transportestimated that last year35,000 people diedfrom traffic crashes in the US alone.Worldwide, 1.2 million peopledie every year in traffic accidents.If there was a way we could eliminate90 percent of those accidents,would you support it?Of course you would.This is what driverless car technologypromises to achieveby eliminating the mainsource of accidents —human error. Now picture yourselfin a driverless car in the year 2030,sitting back and watchingthis vintage TEDxCambridge video. (Laughter) All of a sudden,the car experiences mechanical failureand is unable to stop.If the car continues,it will crash into a bunchof pedestrians crossing the street,but the car may swerve,hitting one bystander,killing them to save the pedestrians.What should the car do,and who should decide?What if instead the carcould swerve into a wall,crashing and killing you, the passenger,in order to save those pedestrians?This scenario is inspiredby the trolley problem,which was inventedby philosophers a few decades agoto think about ethics. Now, the way we thinkabout this problem matters.We may for examplenot think about it at all.We may say this scenario is unrealistic,incredibly unlikely, or just silly.But I think this criticismmisses the pointbecause it takesthe scenario too literally.Of course no accidentis going to look like this;no accident has two or three optionswhere everybody dies somehow.Instead, the car is goingto calculate somethinglike the probability of hittinga certain group of people,if you swerve one directionversus another direction,you might slightly increase the riskto passengers or other driversversus pedestrians.It's going to bea more complex calculation,but it's still goingto involve trade-offs,and trade-offs often require ethics. We might say then,\"Well, let's not worry about this.Let's wait until technologyis fully ready and 100 percent safe.\"Suppose that we can indeedeliminate 90 percent of those accidents,or even 99 percent in the next 10 years.What if eliminatingthe last one percent of accidentsrequires 50 more years of research?Should we not adopt the technology?That's 60 million peopledead in car accidentsif we maintain the current rate.So the point is,waiting for full safety is also a choice,and it also involves trade-offs. People online on social mediahave been coming up with all sorts of waysto not think about this problem.One person suggestedthe car should just swerve somehowin between the passengers —n(Laughter) and the bystander.Of course if that's what the car can do,that's what the car should do.We're interested in scenariosin which this is not possible.And my personal favoritewas a suggestion by a bloggerto have an eject button in the carthat you press —n(Laughter) just before the car self-destructs. (Laughter) So if we acknowledge that carswill have to make trade-offs on the road,how do we think about those trade-offs,and how do we decide?Well, maybe we should run a surveyto find out what society wants,because ultimately,regulations and the laware a reflection of societal values. So this is what we did.With my collaborators,Jean-François Bonnefon and Azim Shariff,we ran a surveyin which we presented peoplewith these types of scenarios.We gave them two optionsinspired by two philosophers:Jeremy Bentham and Immanuel Kant.Bentham says the carshould follow utilitarian ethics:it should take the actionthat will minimize total harm —even if that action will kill a bystanderand even if that actionwill kill the passenger.Immanuel Kant says the carshould follow duty-bound principles,like \"Thou shalt not kill.\"So you should not take an actionthat explicitly harms a human being,and you should let the car take its courseeven if that's going to harm more people. What do you think?Bentham or Kant?Here's what we found.Most people sided with Bentham.So it seems that peoplewant cars to be utilitarian,minimize total harm,and that's what we should all do.Problem solved.But there is a little catch.When we asked peoplewhether they would purchase such cars,they said, \"Absolutely not.\"n(Laughter) They would like to buy carsthat protect them at all costs,but they want everybody elseto buy cars that minimize harm. (Laughter) We've seen this problem before.It's called a social dilemma.And to understand the social dilemma,we have to go a little bitback in history.In the 1800s,English economist William Forster Lloydpublished a pamphletwhich describes the following scenario.You have a group of farmers —English farmers —who are sharing a common landfor their sheep to graze.Now, if each farmerbrings a certain number of sheep —let's say three sheep —the land will be rejuvenated,the farmers are happy,the sheep are happy,everything is good.Now, if one farmer brings one extra sheep,that farmer will do slightly better,and no one else will be harmed.But if every farmer madethat individually rational decision,the land will be overrun,and it will be depletedto the detriment of all the farmers,and of course,to the detriment of the sheep. We see this problem in many places:in the difficulty of managing overfishing,or in reducing carbon emissionsto mitigate climate change.When it comes to the regulationof driverless cars,the common land nowis basically public safety —that's the common good —and the farmers are the passengersor the car owners who are choosingto ride in those cars.And by making the individuallyrational choiceof prioritizing their own safety,they may collectively bediminishing the common good,which is minimizing total harm.It's called the tragedy of the commons,traditionally,but I think in the caseof driverless cars,the problem may bea little bit more insidiousbecause there is not necessarilyan individual human beingmaking those decisions.So car manufacturersmay simply program carsthat will maximize safetyfor their clients,and those cars may learnautomatically on their ownthat doing so requires slightlyincreasing risk for pedestrians.So to use the sheep metaphor,it's like we now have electric sheepthat have a mind of their own. (Laughter) And they may go and grazeeven if the farmer doesn't know it. So this is what we may callthe tragedy of the algorithmic commons,and if offers new types of challenges.Typically, traditionally,we solve these typesof social dilemmas using regulation,so either governmentsor communities get together,and they decide collectivelywhat kind of outcome they wantand what sort of constraintson individual behaviorthey need to implement.And then using monitoring and enforcement,they can make surethat the public good is preserved.So why don't we just,as regulators,require that all cars minimize harm?After all, this iswhat people say they want.And more importantly,I can be sure that as an individual,if I buy a car that maysacrifice me in a very rare case,I'm not the only sucker doing thatwhile everybody elseenjoys unconditional protection. In our survey, we did ask peoplewhether they would support regulationand here's what we found.First of all, peoplesaid no to regulation;and second, they said,\"Well if you regulate cars to do thisand to minimize total harm,I will not buy those cars.\"So ironically,by regulating cars to minimize harm,we may actually end up with more harmbecause people may notopt into the safer technologyeven if it's much saferthan human drivers. I don't have the finalanswer to this riddle,but I think as a starting point,we need society to come togetherto decide what trade-offswe are comfortable withand to come up with waysin which we can enforce those trade-offs. As a starting point,my brilliant students,Edmond Awad and Sohan Dsouza,built the Moral Machine website,which generates random scenarios at you —basically a bunchof random dilemmas in a sequencewhere you have to choose whatthe car should do in a given scenario.And we vary the ages and eventhe species of the different victims.So far we've collectedover five million decisionsby over one million people worldwidefrom the website.And this is helping usform an early pictureof what trade-offspeople are comfortable withand what matters to them —even across cultures.But more importantly,doing this exerciseis helping people recognizethe difficulty of making those choicesand that the regulatorsare tasked with impossible choices.And maybe this will help us as a societyunderstand the kinds of trade-offsthat will be implementedultimately in regulation. And indeed, I was very happy to hearthat the first set of regulationsthat came fromthe Department of Transport —announced last week —included a 15-point checklistfor all carmakers to provide,and number 14 was ethical consideration —how are you going to deal with that.We also have peoplereflect on their own decisionsby giving them summariesof what they chose.I'll give you one example —I'm just going to warn youthat this is not your typical example,your typical user.This is the most sacrificed and the mostsaved character for this person. (Laughter) Some of you may agree with him,or her, we don't know.But this person also seems to slightlyprefer passengers over pedestriansin their choicesand is very happy to punish jaywalking. (Laughter) So let's wrap up.We started with the question —let's call it the ethical dilemma —of what the car should doin a specific scenario:swerve or stay?But then we realizedthat the problem was a different one.It was the problem of how to getsociety to agree on and enforcethe trade-offs they're comfortable with.It's a social dilemma. In the 1940s, Isaac Asimovwrote his famous laws of robotics —the three laws of robotics.A robot may not harm a human being,a robot may not disobey a human being,and a robot may not allowitself to come to harm —in this order of importance.But after 40 years or soand after so many storiespushing these laws to the limit,Asimov introduced the zeroth lawwhich takes precedence above all,and it's that a robotmay not harm humanity as a whole.I don't know what this meansin the context of driverless carsor any specific situation,and I don't know how we can implement it,but I think that by recognizingthat the regulation of driverless carsis not only a technological problembut also a societal cooperation problem,I hope that we can at least beginto ask the right questions. Thank you. (Applause) Should your driverless car kill you if it means saving five pedestrians? In this primer on the social dilemmas of driverless cars, Iyad Rahwan explores how the technology will challenge our morality and explains his work collecting data from real people on the ethical trade-offs we're willing (and not willing) to make. Iyad Rahwan's work lies at the intersection of the computer and social sciences, with a focus on collective intelligence, large-scale cooperation and the social aspects of artificial intelligence.

11	"I want you to touch your face.Go on.What do you feel?Soft? Squishy?It's you, right? You're feeling you?Well, it's not quite true.You're actually feelingthousands of microscopic creaturesthat live on our face and fingers.You're feeling some of the fungithat drifted downfrom the air ducts today.They set off our allergiesand smell of mildew.You're feeling someof the 100 billion bacterial cellsthat live on our skin.They've been munching awayat your skin oils and replicating,producing the smells of body odor.You're likely even touchingthe fecal bacteriathat sprayed onto you the last timeyou flushed a toilet,or those bacteria that livein our water pipesand sprayed onto youwith your last shower.Sorry. (Laughter) You're probably even givinga microscopic high fiveto the two species of mitesthat live on our faces,on all of our faces.They've spent the nightsquirming across your faceand having sex on the bridge of your nose. (Laughter) Many of them are now leakingtheir gut contents onto your pores. (Laughter) Now look at your finger.How's it feel? Gross?In desperate need of soap or bleach?That's how you feel now,but it's not going to behow you feel in the future. For the last 100 years,we've had an adversarial relationshipwith the microscopic life nearest us.If I told you there wasa bug in your houseor bacteria in your sink,there was a human-devisedsolution for that,a product to eradicate, exterminate,disinfect.We strive to remove mostof the microscopic life in our world now.But in doing so, we're ignoringthe best source of new technologyon this planet.The last 100 years have featuredhuman solutions to microbial problems,but the next 100 years will featuremicrobial solutions to human problems. I'm a scientist, and I workwith researchersat North Carolina State Universityand the University of Coloradoto uncover the microscopiclife that is nearest us,and that's often in our most intimateand boring environments,be it under our couches, in our backyards,or in our belly buttons.I do this work because it turns outthat we know very littleabout the microscopic lifethat's nearest us.As of a few years ago,no scientist could tell youwhat bugs or microorganismslive in your home —your home, the place you knowbetter than anywhere else. And so I and teams of othersare armed with Q-tips and tweezersand advanced DNA techniquesto uncover the microscopiclife nearest us.In doing so, we foundover 600 species of bugsthat live in USA homes,everything from spiders and cockroachesto tiny mites that cling to feathers.And we found over 100,000 speciesof bacteria and fungithat live in our dust bunnies,thousands more that liveon our clothes or in our showers.We've gone further still,and we looked at the microorganismsthat live inside the bodiesof each of those bugs in our home.In each bug, for example, a wasp,we see a microscopic jungleunfold in a petri plate,a world of hundreds of vibrant species.Behold the biological cosmos!So many of the speciesyou're looking at right nowdon't yet have names.Most of the life around usremains unknown. I remember the first time I discoveredand got to name a new species.It was a fungus that livesin the nest of a paper wasp.It's white and fluffy,and I named it \"mucor nidicola,\"meaning in Latin that it livesin the nest of another.This is a picture of itgrowing on a dinosaur,because everyonethinks dinosaurs are cool.At the time, I was in graduate school,and I was so excitedthat I had found this new life form.I called up my dad, and I go,\"Dad! I just discovereda new microorganism species.\"And he laughed and he goes,\"That's great. I hope you alsodiscovered a cure for it.\"n(Laughter) \"Cure it.\"nNow, my dad is my biggest fan,so in that crushing moment where he wantedto kill my new little life form,I realized that actually I had failed him,both as a daughter and a scientist.In my years toiling away in labsand in people's backyards,investigating and catalogingthe microscopic life around us,I'd never made clearmy true mission to him.My goal is not to find technologyto kill the new microscopiclife around us.My goal is to find new technologyfrom this life, that will help save us. The diversity of life in our homes is morethan a list of 100,000 new species.It is 100,000 new sourcesof solutions to human problems.I know it's hard to believethat anything that's so smallor only has one cellcan do anything powerful,but they can.These creaturesare microscopic alchemists,with the ability to transformtheir environmentwith an arsenal of chemical tools.This means that they can liveanywhere on this planet,and they can eat whateverfood is around them.This means they can eat everythingfrom toxic waste to plastic,and they can produce waste productslike oil and battery powerand even tiny nuggets of real gold.They can transform the inedibleinto nutritive.They can make sugar into alcohol.They give chocolate its flavor,and soil the power to grow. I'm here to tell youthat the next 100 years will featurethese microscopic creaturessolving more of our problems.And we have a lot of problemsto choose from.We've got the mundane:bad-smelling clothes or bland food.And we've got the monumental:disease, pollution, war.And so this is my mission:to not just catalogthe microscopic life around us,but to find out what it's uniquelywell-suited to help us with. Here's an example.We started with a pest,a wasp that lives on many of our homes.Inside that wasp, we plucked outa little-known microorganism specieswith a unique ability:it could make beer.This is a trait that onlya few species on this planet have.In fact, all commercially producedbeer you've ever hadlikely came from one of onlythree microorganism species.Yet our species, it could makea beer that tasted like honey,and it could also makea delightfully tart beer.In fact, this microorganism speciesthat lives in the belly of a wasp,it could make a valuable sour beerbetter than any other specieson this planet.There are now four speciesthat produce commercial beer.Where you used to see a pest,now think of tastingyour future favorite beer. As a second example,I worked with researchersto dig in the dirt in people's backyards.There, we uncovered a microorganismthat could make novel antibiotics,antibiotics that can killthe world's worst superbugs.This was an awesome thing to find,but here's the secret:for the last 60 years,most of the antibiotics on the markethave come from similar soil bacteria.Every day, you and Iand everyone in this roomand on this planet,are saved by similar soil bacteriathat produce most of our antibiotics.Where you used to see dirt,now think of medication. Perhaps my favorite examplecomes from colleagueswho are studyinga pond scum microorganism,which is tragically named afterthe cow dung it was first found in.It's pretty unremarkableand would be unworthy of discussion,except that the researchers foundthat if you feed it to mice,it vaccinates against PTSD.It vaccinates against fear.Where you used to see pond scum,now think of hope. There are so many more microbial examplesthat I don't have timeto talk about today.I gave you examples of solutionsthat came from just three species,but imagine what those other100,000 species in your dust bunniesmight be able to do.In the future, they might be ableto make you sexieror smarteror perhaps live longer. So I want you to lookat your finger again.Think about all thosemicroscopic creaturesthat are unknown.Think about in the futurewhat they might be able to door makeor whose life they might be able to save.How does your finger feel right now?A little bit powerful?That's because you're feeling the future. Thank you. (Applause) Behold the microscopic jungle in and around you: tiny organisms living on your cheeks, under your sofa and in the soil in your backyard. We have an adversarial relationship with these microbes — we sanitize, exterminate and disinfect them — but according to microbiologist Anne Madden, they're sources of new technologies and medicines waiting to be discovered. These microscopic alchemists aren't gross, Madden says — they're the future. Whether brewing better beer, discovering novel antibiotics or chronicling the lives of the microscopic creatures living in the dust under the couch, Anne Madden seeks to understand and utilize the microbial world around us.

12	"Cancer.Many of us have lost family,friends or loved onesto this horrible disease.I know there are some of youin the audiencewho are cancer survivors,or who are fighting cancer at this moment.My heart goes out to you.While this word often conjures upemotions of sadness and anger and fear,I bring you good newsfrom the front lines of cancer research.The fact is, we are starting to winthe war on cancer.In fact, we lie at the intersectionof the three of the most excitingdevelopments within cancer research. The first is cancer genomics.The genome is a compositionof all the genetic informationencoded by DNAin an organism.In cancers, changesin the DNA called mutationsare what drive these cancersto go out of control.Around 10 years ago,I was part of the team at Johns Hopkinsthat first mappedthe mutations of cancers.We did this first for colorectal,breast, pancreatic and brain cancers.And since then, there have beenover 90 projects in 70 countriesall over the world,working to understandthe genetic basis of these diseases.Today, tens of thousandsof cancers are understooddown to exquisite molecular detail. The second revolutionis precision medicine,also known as \"personalized medicine.\"Instead of one-size-fits-all methodsto be able to treat cancers,there is a whole new class of drugsthat are able to target cancersbased on their unique genetic profile.Today, there are a hostof these tailor-made drugs,called targeted therapies,available to physicians even todayto be able to personalizetheir therapy for their patients,and many others are in development. The third exciting revolutionis immunotherapy,and this is really exciting.Scientists have been ableto leverage the immune systemin the fight against cancer.For example, there have been wayswhere we find the off switches of cancer,and new drugs have been ableto turn the immune system back on,to be able to fight cancer.In addition, there are wayswhere you can take away immune cellsfrom the body,train them, engineer themand put them back into the bodyto fight cancer.Almost sounds likescience fiction, doesn't it? While I was a researcherat the National Cancer Institute,I had the privilege of workingwith some of the pioneers of this fieldand watched the development firsthand.It's been pretty amazing.Today, over 600 clinical trials are open,actively recruiting patientsto explore all aspects in immunotherapy. While these three excitingrevolutions are ongoing,unfortunately, this is only the beginning,and there are still many, many challenges.Let me illustrate with a patient.Here is a patientwith a skin cancer called melanoma.It's horrible; the cancerhas gone everywhere.However, scientists were ableto map the mutations of this cancerand give a specific treatmentthat targets one of the mutations.And the result is almost miraculous.Tumors almost seem to melt away.Unfortunately, this is notthe end of the story.A few months later, this picture is taken.The tumor has come back.The question is: Why?The answer is tumor heterogeneity.Let me explain. Even a cancer as smallas one centimeter in diameterharbors over a hundred milliondifferent cells.While genetically similar,there are small differencesin these different cancersthat make them differently proneto different drugs.So even if you have a drugthat's highly effective,that kills almost all the cells,there is a chancethat there's a small populationthat's resistant to the drug.This ultimately is the populationthat comes back,and takes over the patient. So then the question is:What do we do with this information?Well, the key, then,is to apply all these excitingadvancements in cancer therapy earlier,as soon as we can,before these resistance clones emerge.The key to cancer and curing canceris early detection.And we intuitively know this.Finding cancer earlyresults in better outcomes,and the numbers show this as well.For example, in ovarian cancer,if you detect cancer in stage four,only 17 percent of the womensurvive at five years.However, if you are able to detectthis cancer as early as stage one,over 92 percent of women will survive.But the sad fact is, only 15 percentof women are detected at stage one,whereas the vast majority, 70 percent,are detected in stages three and four. We desperately needbetter detection mechanisms for cancers.The current best ways to screen cancerfall into one of three categories.First is medical procedures,which is like colonoscopyfor colon cancer.Second is protein biomarkers,like PSA for prostate cancer.Or third, imaging techniques,such as mammography for breast cancer.Medical procedures are the gold standard;however, they are highly invasiveand require a largeinfrastructure to implement.Protein markers, while effectivein some populations,are not very specificin some circumstances,resulting in high numbersof false positives,which then results in unnecessary work-upsand unnecessary procedures.Imaging methods,while useful in some populations,expose patients to harmful radiation.In addition, it is not applicableto all patients.For example, mammography has problemsin women with dense breasts. So what we need is a methodthat is noninvasive,that is light in infrastructure,that is highly specific,that also does not have false positives,does not use any radiationand is applicable to large populations.Even more importantly,we need a methodto be able to detect cancersbefore they're 100 million cells in size.Does such a technology exist?Well, I wouldn't be up heregiving a talk if it didn't. I'm excited to tell you aboutthis latest technology we've developed.Central to our technologyis a simple blood test.The blood circulatory system,while seemingly mundane,is essential for you to survive,providing oxygenand nutrients to your cells,and removing waste and carbon dioxide.Here's a key biological insight:Cancer cells grow and diefaster than normal cells,and when they die,DNA is shed into the blood system.Since we know the signaturesof these cancer cellsfrom all the different cancergenome sequencing projects,we can look for those signals in the bloodto be able to detect these cancers early.So instead of waiting for cancersto be large enough to cause symptoms,or for them to be dense enoughto show up on imaging,or for them to be prominent enoughfor you to be able to visualizeon medical procedures,we can start looking for cancerswhile they are relatively pretty small,by looking for these small amountsof DNA in the blood. So let me tell you how we do this.First, like I said, we start offwith a simple blood test —no radiation, no complicated equipment —a simple blood test.Then the blood is shipped to us,and what we dois extract the DNA out of it.While your body is mostly healthy cells,most of the DNA that's detectedwill be from healthy cells.However, there will be a small amount,less than one percent,that comes from the cancer cells.Then we use molecular biology methodsto be able to enrich this DNAfor areas of the genome which are knownto be associated with cancer,based on the informationfrom the cancer genomics projects.We're able to then put this DNAinto DNA-sequencing machinesand are able to digitize the DNAinto A's, C's, T's and G'sand have this final readout.Ultimately, we have informationof billions of lettersthat output from this run.We then apply statisticaland computational methodsto be able to findthe small signal that's present,indicative of the small amountof cancer DNA in the blood. So does this actually work in patients?Well, because there's no wayof really predicting right nowwhich patients will get cancer,we use the next best population:cancers in remission;specifically, lung cancer.The sad fact is, even with the best drugsthat we have today,most lung cancers come back.The key, then, is to seewhether we're able to detectthese recurrences of cancersearlier than with standard methods. We just finished a major trialwith Professor Charles Swantonat University College London,examining this.Let me walk you throughan example of one patient.Here's an example of one patientwho undergoes surgeryat time point zero,and then undergoes chemotherapy.Then the patient is under remission.He is monitored using clinical examsand imaging methods.Around day 450, unfortunately,the cancer comes back.The question is:Are we able to catch this earlier?During this whole time,we've been collecting blood seriallyto be able to measurethe amount of ctDNA in the blood.So at the initial time point, as expected,there's a high levelof cancer DNA in the blood.However, this goes away to zeroin subsequent time pointsand remains negligibleafter subsequent points.However, around day 340, we see the riseof cancer DNA in the blood,and eventually, it goes up higherfor days 400 and 450. Here's the key, if you've missed it:At day 340, we see the risein the cancer DNA in the blood.That means we are catching this cancerover a hundred days earlierthan traditional methods.This is a hundred days earlierwhere we can give therapies,a hundred days earlierwhere we can do surgical interventions,or even a hundred days lessfor the cancer to growor a hundred days lessfor resistance to occur.For some patients, this hundred daysmeans the matter of life and death.We're really excitedabout this information. Because of this assignment,we've done additional studies nowin other cancers,including breast cancer, lung cancerand ovarian cancer,and I can't wait to see how much earlierwe can find these cancers. Ultimately, I have a dream,a dream of two vials of blood,and that, in the future, as part of allof our standard physical exams,we'll have two vials of blood drawn.And from these two vials of bloodwe will be able to comparethe DNA from all knownsignatures of cancer,and hopefully then detect cancersmonths to even years earlier.Even with the therapies we have currently,this could mean that millionsof lives could be saved.And if you add on to thatrecent advancements in immunotherapyand targeted therapies,the end of cancer is in sight. The next time you hear the word \"cancer,\"I want you to add to the emotions: hope.Hold on.Cancer researchers all around the worldare working feverishlyto beat this disease,and tremendous progress is being made. This is the beginning of the end.We will win the war on cancer.And to me, this is amazing news. Thank you. (Applause) Jimmy Lin is developing technologies to catch cancer months to years before current methods. He shares a breakthrough technique that looks for small signals of cancer's presence via a simple blood test, detecting the recurrence of some forms of the disease 100 days earlier than traditional methods. It could be a ray of hope in a fight where early detection makes all the difference. TED Fellow Jimmy Lin is developing technologies to catch cancer early.

13	"So, I love making toolsand sharing them with people.I remember as a child,my first tool I builtwas actually a microscopethat I built by stealing lensesfrom my brother's eyeglasses.He wasn't that thrilled.But, you know, maybebecause of that moment,30 years later,I'm still making microscopes.And the reason I built these toolsis for moments like this. (Video) Girl: I haveblack things in my hair —nManu Prakash: This is a schoolin the Bay Area. (Video) MP: The living worldfar supersedes our imaginationof how things actually work. (Video) Boy: Oh my God!nMP: Right — oh my God!I hadn't realized this would besuch a universal phrase. Over the last two years,in my lab,we built 50,000 Foldscopesand shipped themto 130 countries in the world,at no cost to the kids we sent them to.This year alone,with the support of our community,we are planning to shipa million microscopesto kids around the world.What does that do?It creates an inspiring communityof people around the world,learning and teaching each other,from Kenya to Kampalato Kathmandu to Kansas. And one of the phenomenal thingsthat I love about thisis the sense of community.There's a kid in Nicaraguateaching others how to identifymosquito species that carry dengueby looking at the larvaunder a microscope.There's a pharmacologistwho came up with a new wayto detect fake drugs anywhere.There is a girl who wondered:\"How does glitter actually work?\"and discovered the physicsof crystalline formation in glitter.There is an Argentinian doctorwho's trying to do field cervical cancerscreening with this tool.And yours very truly founda species of fleathat was dug inside my heel in my footone centimeter deep. Now, you might thinkof these as anomalies.But there is a method to this madness.I call this \"frugal science\" —the idea of sharingthe experience of science,and not just the information.To remind you:there are a billion people on this planetwho live with absolutelyno infrastructure:no roads,no electricityand thus, no health care.Also, there a billion kidson this planet that live in poverty.How are we supposed to inspire themfor the next generationof solution makers?There are health care workersthat we put on the lineto fight infectious diseases,to protect us with absolutelybare-minimum tools and resources. So as a lab at Stanford,I think of this from a contextof frugal scienceand building solutionsfor these communities.Often we think about being able to dodiagnosis under a tree, off-grid.I'll tell you two examplestoday of new tools.One of them starts in Uganda.In 2013,on a field trip to detectschistosomiasis with Foldscopes,I made a minor observation.In a clinic,in a far, remote area,I saw a centrifugebeing used as a doorstop.I mean — quite literally, the doorstop.And I asked them and they said,\"Oh, we don't actually have electricity,so this piece of junkis good as a doorstop.\"Centrifuges, for some of youwho don't know,are the pinnacle tool to be ableto do sample processing.You separate componentsof blood or body fluidsto be able to detectand identify pathogens.But centrifuges are bulky, expensive —cost around 1,000 dollars —and really hard to carry out in the field.And of course,they don't work without power.Sound familiar?So we started thinkingabout solving this problem,and I came back —kept thinking about toys. Now ...I have a few with me here.I first started with yo-yos ...and I'm a terrible yo-yo thrower.Because these objects spin,we wondered,could we actually usethe physics of these objectsto be able to build centrifuges?This was possibly the worstthrow I could make.But you might start realizing,if you start exploringthe space of toys —we tried these spinning tops,and then in the lab,we stumbled upon this wonder. It's the whirligig,or a buzzer, or a rundle.A couple of strings and a little disk,and if I push, it spins.How many of you have playedwith this as a kid?This is called a button-on-a-string.OK, maybe 50 percent of you.What you didn't realize —that this little objectis the oldest toyin the history of mankind ...5,000 years ago.We have found relics of this objecthidden around on our planet.Now the irony is,we actually don't understandhow this little thing works.That's when I get excited. So we got back to work,wrote down a couple of equations.If you take the input torquethat you put in,you take the drag on this disc,and the twist drag on these strings,you should be ableto mathematically solve this.This is not the only equation in my talk.Ten pages of math later,we could actually write downthe complete analytical solutionfor this dynamic system.And out comes what we call \"Paperfuge.\"That's my postdoc Saad Bhamla,who's the co-inventor of Paperfuge.And to the left, you seeall the centrifugesthat we're trying to replace. This little object that you see right hereis a disc, a coupleof strings and a handle.And when I spinand I push,it starts to spin.Now, when you realize,when you do the math,when we calculate the rpm for this object,mathematically, we should be ableto go all the way to a million rpm.Now, there is a little twistin human anatomy,because the resonant frequencyof this object is about 10 hertz,and if you've ever played the piano,you can't go higherthan two or three hertz.The maximum speed we've been ableto achieve with this objectis not 10,000 rpm,not 50,000 rpm —120,000 rpm.That's equal to 30,000 g-forces.If I was to stick you right hereand have it spin,you would think about the typesof forces you would experience. One of the factors of a tool like thisis to be able to do diagnosis with this.So, I'm going to doa quick demo here, where —this is a moment where I'm goingto make a little finger prick,and a tiny drop of bloodis going to come out.If you don't like blood,you don't have to look at it.Here is a little lancet.These lancets are available everywhere,completely passive.And if I've had breakfast today ...That didn't hurt at all.OK, I take a little capillarywith a drop of blood —now this drop of blood has answers,that's why I'm interested in it.It might actually tell me whetherI have malaria right now or not.I take a little capillary,and you see it starts wicking in.I'm going to draw a little more blood.And that's good enough for right now.Now, I just seal this capillaryby putting it in clay.And now that's sealed the sample. We're going to take the sample,mount it on Paperfuge.A little piece of tapeto make a sealed cavity.So now the sample is completely enclosed.And we are ready for a spin.I'm pushing and pulling with this object.I'm going to load this up ...And you see the object starts spinning.Unlike a regular centrifuge,this is a counter-rotating centrifuge.It goes back and forth, back and forth ...And now I'm charging it up,and you see it builds momentum.And now — I don't knowif you can hear this —30 seconds of this,and I should be able to separateall the blood cells with the plasma.And the ratio of those blood cells to plasma —n(Applause) Already, if you see right here,if you focus on this,you should be able to seea separated volumeof blood and plasma.And the ratio of that actually tells mewhether I might be anemic. One of the aspects of this is,we build many types of Paperfuges.This one allows us to identifymalaria parasitesby running them for a little longer,and we can identify malaria parasitesthat are in the bloodthat we can separate out and detectwith something like a centrifuge.Another version of this allows meto separate nucleic acidsto be able to do nucleic acid testsout in the field itself.Here is another version that allows meto separate bulk samples,and then, finally,something new that we've been working onto be able to implement the entiremultiplex test on an object like this.So where you do the sample preparationand the chemistry in the same object. Now ...this is all good,but when you start thinking about this,you have to share these tools with people.And one of the things we did is —we just got back from Madagascar;this is what clinical trialsfor malaria look like —n(Laughter) You can do this while having coffee.But most importantly,this is a village six hours from any road.We are in a room with one of the seniormembers of the communityand a health care worker.It really is this portion of the workthat excites me the most —that smile,to be able to share simple but powerfultools with people around the world.Now, I forgot to tell you this,that all of that cost me 20 cents to make. OK, in the negative time I have left,I'll tell you about the most recent —n(Laughter) invention from our lab.It's called Abuzz —the idea that all of youcould help us fight mosquitoes;you could all help us track our enemies.These are enemies because they causemalaria, Zika, chikungunya, dengue.But the challenge is that we actuallydon't know where our enemies are.The world map for wheremosquitoes are is missing.So we started thinking about this.There are 3,500 species of mosquitoes,and they're all very similar.Some of them are so identicalthat even an entomologist cannotidentify them under a microscope. But they have an Achilles' heel.This is what mosquitoes flirtingwith each other looks like.That's a male chasing a female.They're actually talking to each otherwith their wingbeat frequencies.(Buzzing sound)And thus, they have a signature.We realized that using a regular phone,a $5-10 flip phone —how many remember what this object is? (Laughter) We can record these acousticsignatures from mosquitoes.I'll tell you exactly how to do this. I caught some mosquitoes outside.Unlike Bill [Gates], I'm notgoing to release them. (Laughter) But I will tell you howto record from this.All you do is tap them and they fly.You can first test —I can actually hear that.And you bring your phone,which has microphones —it turns out the micsare so damn good already,even on regular phones,that you can pick upthis near-field signature.And since I'm out of time,let me just play the recordingthat I made a day ago. (Mosquitoes buzz) This is all the charming soundthat you heard beforethat you all love.One of the contexts of thisis that being able to do thiswith a regular cell phoneallows us to map mosquito species.Using a flip phone,we mapped one of the largestacoustic databaseswith 25 to 20 species of mosquitoesthat carry human pathogens.And from this and machine learning,anybody who uploads this data,we can identify and tell the probabilityof what species of mosquitoesyou're actually working with.We call this Abuzz,and if any of you want to sign up,just go to the website. Let me close with somethingthat's very importantand dear to my heart.One of the challenges of todayis we have terrible problems.We have a billion peoplewith absolutely no health care,climate change, biodiversity loss,on and on and on.And we hope that scienceis going to provide the answer. But before you leave this theatre today,I want you to promise one thing.We're going to make science accessible —not just to the people who can afford it,but a billion others who can't.Let's make science and scientificliteracy a human right.The moment that you pass the tinglingfeeling of making a discoveryto another child,you're enabling them to bethe next group of peoplewho will actually solve these problems. Thank you. (Applause) Inventor Manu Prakash turns everyday materials into powerful scientific devices, from paper microscopes to a clever new mosquito tracker. From the TED Fellows stage, he demos Paperfuge, a hand-powered centrifuge inspired by a spinning toy that costs 20 cents to make and can do the work of a $1,000 machine, no electricity required.

14	"I visit the future for a living.Not just one future,but many possible futures,bringing back evidences from those futuresfor you to experience today.Like an archaeologist of the future.Over the years, my many journeyshave brought back thingslike a new speciesof synthetically engineered bees;a book named, \"Pets as Protein;\"a machine that makes you richby trading your genetic data;a lamp powered by sugar;a computer for growing food. OK, so I don't actually travelto different futures — yet.But my husband Jon and I spenda lot of time thinkingand creating visionsof different futures in our studio.We are constantly looking outfor weak signals,those murmurs of future potential.Then we trace those threads of potentialout into the future, asking:What might it feel liketo live in this future?What might we see, hear and even breathe?Then we run experiments,build prototypes, make objects,bringing aspects of these futures to life,making them concrete and tangibleso you can really feel the impactof those future possibilitieshere and now.But this work is not about predictions.It's about creating tools —tools that can help connectour present and our future selvesso we become active participantsin creating a future we want —a future that works for all. So how do we go about doing this?For a recent project called Drone Aviary,we were interested in exploringwhat it would mean to livewith drones in our cities.Drones that have the powerto see things we can't,to go places we can'tand to do so with increasing autonomy.But to understand the technology,getting our hands dirty was crucial.So we built several differentdrones in our studio.We gave them names, functionsand then flew them —but not without difficulty.Things came loose,GPS signals glitchedand drones crashed.But it was through such experimentationthat we could construct a veryconcrete and very experiential sliceof one possible future. So now, let's go to that future.Let's imagine we are living in a citywith drones like this one.We call it The Nightwatchman.It patrols the streets, often spottedin the evenings and at night.Initially, many of us were annoyedby its low, dull hum.But then, like everything else,we got used to it.Now, what if you could seethe world through its eyes?See how it constantly logsevery resident of our neighborhood;logging the kids who play footballin the no-ballgame areaand marking them as statutory nuisances. (Laughter) And then see how it dispersesthis other group, who are teenagers,with the threat of an autonomouslyissued injunction.And then there's this giantfloating disc called Madison.Its glaring presence is so overpowering,I can't help but stare at it.But if feels like each time I look at it,it knows a little more about me —like it keeps flashing all theseBrianair adverts at me,as if it knows aboutthe holiday I'm planning.I'm not sure if I find thismildly entertainingor just entirely invasive. Back to the present.In creating this future, we learned a lot.Not just about how these machines work,but what it would feel liketo live alongside them.Whilst drones like Madisonand Nightwatchman,in these particular forms,are not real yet,most elements of a drone futureare in fact very real today.For instance,facial recognition systemsare everywhere —in our phones, even in our thermostatsand in cameras around our cities —keeping a record of everything we do,whether it's an advertisementwe glanced at or a protest we attended.These things are here,and we often don't understandhow they work,and what their consequences could be.And we see this all around us.This difficulty in even imagininghow the consequences of our actionstoday will affect our future. Last year, where I live, in the UK,there was a referendumwhere the people could votefor the UK to leave the EUor stay in the EU,popularly known as \"Brexit.\"And soon after the results came out,a word began to surfacecalled \"Bregret\" —n(Laughter) describing people who chose to votefor Brexit as a protest,but without thinking throughits potential consequences.And this disconnect is evidentin some of the simplest things.Say you go out for a quick drink.Then you decideyou wouldn't mind a few more.You know you'll wake upin the morning feeling awful,but you justify it by saying,\"The other me in the futurewill deal with that.\"But as we find out in the morning,that future \"you\" is you. When I was growing up in Indiain the late '70s and early '80s,there was a feelingthat the future both needed toand could actually be planned.I remember my parents had to planfor some of the simplest things.When they wanted a telephone in our house,they needed to order it and then wait —wait for nearly five years beforeit got installed in our house. (Laughter) And then if they wanted to callmy grandparents who lived in another city,they needed to booksomething called a \"trunk call,\"and then wait again,for hours or even days.And then abruptly, the phonewould ring at two in the morning,and all of us would jump out of our bedsand gather round the phone,shrieking into it,discussing general well-beingat two in the morning. Today it can feel like thingsare happening too fast —so fast, that it canbecome really difficultfor us to form an understandingof our place in history.It creates an overwhelming senseof uncertainty and anxiety,and so, we let the futurejust happen to us.We don't connect with that future \"us.\"We treat our future selves as a stranger,and the future as a foreign land.It's not a foreign land;it's unfolding right in front of us,continually being shapedby our actions today.We are that future,and so I believe fightingfor a future we wantis more urgent and necessarythan ever before. We have learned in our workthat one of the most powerful meansof effecting changeis when people can directly, tangiblyand emotionally experiencesome of the future consequencesof their actions today.Earlier this year, the governmentof the United Arab Emirates invited usto help them shapetheir country's energy strategyall the way up to 2050.Based on the government's econometricdata, we created this large city model,and visualized manypossible futures on it.As I was excitably taking a groupof government officialsand members of energy companiesthrough one sustainablefuture on our model,one of the participants told me,\"I cannot imagine that in the futurepeople will stop driving carsand start using public transport.\"And then he said,\"There's no way I can tell my own sonto stop driving his car.\"nBut we were prepared for this reaction.Working with scientists in a chemistry labin my home city in India,we had created approximate samplesof what the air would be like in 2030if our behavior stays the same.And so, I walked the groupover to this objectthat emits vapor from those air samples.Just one whiff of the noxiouspolluted air from 2030brought home the pointthat no amount of data can.This is not the future you would wantyour children to inherit.The next day, the governmentmade a big announcement.They would be investing billionsof dollars in renewables.We don't know what part our futureexperiences played in this decision,but we know that they've changedtheir energy policyto mitigate such a scenario. While something like air from the futureis very effective and tangible,the trajectory from our presentto a future consequenceis not always so linear.Even when a technologyis developed with utopian ideals,the moment it leaves the laboratoryand enters the world,it is subject to forces outsideof the creators' control.For one particular project,we investigated medical genomics:the technology of gatheringand using people's genetic datato create personalized medicine.We were asking:What are some of the unintendedconsequences of linking our geneticsto health care?To explore this question further,we created a fictional lawsuit,and brought it to life through 31 piecesof carefully crafted evidence.So we built an illegal genetic clinic,a DIY carbon dioxide incubator,and even bought frozen mice on eBay. So now let's go to that futurewhere this lawsuit is unfolding,and meet the defendant, Arnold Mann.Arnold is being prosecutedby this global giant biotech companycalled Dynamic Genetics,because they have evidencethat Arnold has illegally insertedthe company's patented genetic materialinto his body.How on earth did Arnold manage to do that?Well, it all startedwhen Arnold was asked to submita saliva sample in this spit kitto the NHI —the UK's National HealthInsurance service.When Arnold receivedhis health insurance bill,he was shocked and scaredto see that his premiumshad gone through the roof,beyond anything he or his familycould ever afford. The state's algorithm had scannedhis genetic dataand found the risk of a chronic healthcondition lurking in his DNA.And so Arnold had to start payingtoward the potential costsof that future disease —potential future disease from today.In that moment of fear and panic,Arnold slipped through the cityinto the dark shadowsof this illegal clinic for treatment —a treatment that would modify his DNAso that the state's algorithmwould no longer see him as a risk,and his insurance premiumswould become affordable again.But Arnold was caught.And the legal proceedings in the caseDynamic Genetics v. Mann began. In bringing such a future to life,what was important to uswas that people could actually touch,see and feel its potential,because such an immediate and closeencounter provokes peopleto ask the right questions,questions like:What are the implicationsof living in a worldwhere I'm judged on my genetics?Or: Who might claim ownershipto my genetic data,and what might they do with it?If this feels even slightlyout-there or farfetched,today there's a little-known billbeing passed through the American congressknown as HR 1313, PreservingEmployee Wellness Programs Act.This bill proposes to amend the GeneticInformation Nondiscrimination Act,popularly known as GINA,and would allow employers to askabout family medical historyand genetic datato all employees for the first time.Those who refusewould face large penalties. In the work I've shown so far,whether it was drones or genetic crimes,these stories describe troubling futureswith the intention of helping usavoid those futures.But what about what we can't avoid?Today, especially with climate change,it looks like we are heading for trouble.And so what we want to do nowis to prepare for that futureby developing tools and attitudesthat can help us find hope —hope that can inspire action. Currently, we are runningan experiment in our studio.It's a work in progress.Based on climate data projections,we are exploring a futurewhere the Western world has movedfrom abundance to scarcity.We imagine living in a future citywith repeated flooding,periods with almostno food in supermarkets,economic instabilities,broken supply chains.What can we do to not just survive,but prosper in such a world?What food can we eat? To really step inside these questions,we are building this room in a flatin London from 2050.It's like a little time capsulethat we reclaimed from the future.We stripped it down to the bare minimum.Everything we lovingly put in our homes,like flat-panel TVs,internet-connected fridgesand artisanal furnishingsall had to go.And in its place,we're building food computersfrom abandoned, salvagedand repurposed materials,turning today's wasteinto tomorrow's dinner.For instance,we've just finished building our firstfully automated fogponics machine.It uses the technique of fogponics —so just fog as a nutrient,not even water or soil —to grow things quickly.At the moment,we have successfully grown tomatoes.But we'll need more food than whatwe can grow in this small room.So what else could we foragefrom the city?Insects? Pigeons? Foxes? Earlier, we brought backair from the future.This time we are bringingan entire room from the future,a room full of hope, tools and tacticsto create positive actionin hostile conditions.Spending time in this room,a room that could be our own future home,makes the consequencesof climate change and food insecuritymuch more immediate and tangible. What we're learning through suchexperiments and our practiceand the people we engage withis that creating concrete experiencescan bridge the disconnectbetween today and tomorrow.By putting ourselvesinto different possible futures,by becoming open and willingto embrace the uncertainty and discomfortthat such an act can bring,we have the opportunityto imagine new possibilities.We can find optimistic futures;we can find paths forward;we can move beyond hope into action.It means we have the chanceto change direction,a chance to have our voices heard,a chance to write ourselvesinto a future we want.Other worlds are possible. Thank you. (Applause) Anab Jain brings the future to life, creating experiences where people can touch, see and feel the potential of the world we're creating.

15	"I just want to share with youwhat I have been experiencingover the last five yearsin having the great privilege of travelingto many of the poorestcountries in the world. This scene is oneI see all the time everywhere,and these young childrenare looking at a smartphone,and the smartphone is having a huge impactin even the poorest countries.I said to my team, you know,what I see is a rise in aspirationsall over the world.In fact, it seems to methat there's a convergence of aspirations.And I asked a team of economiststo actually look into this.Is this true?Are aspirations convergingall around the world?So they looked at things like Gallup pollsabout satisfaction in lifeand what they learned wasthat if you have access to the internet,your satisfaction goes up.But another thing happensthat's very important:your reference income,the income to which you compare your own,also goes up.Now, if the reference incomeof a nation, for example,goes up 10 percentby comparing themselves to the outside,then on average,people's own incomeshave to go up at least five percentto maintain the samelevel of satisfaction.But when you get downinto the lower percentiles of income,your income has to go up much moreif the reference incomegoes up 10 percent,something like 20 percent.And so with this rise of aspirations,the fundamental question is:Are we going to have a situationwhere aspirationsare linked to opportunityand you get dynamism and economic growth,like that which happenedin the country I was born in, in Korea?Or are aspirationsgoing to meet frustration? This is a real concern,because between 2012 and 2015,terrorism incidentsincreased by 74 percent.The number of deaths from terrorismwent up 150 percent.Right now, two billion peoplelive in conditionsof fragility, conflict, violence,and by 2030, more than 60 percentof the world's poorwill live in these situationsof fragility, conflict and violence.And so what do we doabout meeting these aspirations?Are there new ways of thinkingabout how we can riseto meet these aspirations?Because if we don't,I'm extremely worried.Aspirations are rising as never beforebecause of access to the internet.Everyone knows how everyone else lives.Has our ability to meet those aspirationsrisen as well? And just to get at the details of this,I want to share with youmy own personal story.This is not my mother,but during the Korean War,my mother literally took her own sister,her younger sister, on her back,and walked at least part of the wayto escape Seoul during the Korean War.Now, through a series of miracles,my mother and father both gotscholarships to go to New York City.They actually met in New York Cityand got married in New York City.My father, too, was a refugee.At the age of 19, he left his familyin the northern part of the country,escaped through the borderand never saw his family again.Now, when they were marriedand living in New York,my father was a waiterat Patricia Murphy's restaurant.Their aspirations went up.They understood what it was liketo live in a place like New York Cityin the 1950s. Well, my brother was bornand they came back to Korea,and we had what I rememberas kind of an idyllic life,but what was happeningin Korea at that timewas the country was oneof the poorest in the worldand there was political upheaval.There were demonstrations just downthe street from our house all the time,students protestingagainst the military government.And at the time,the aspirations of the World Bank Group,the organization I lead now,were extremely low for Korea.Their idea was that Korea wouldfind it difficult without foreign aidto provide its people with morethan the bare necessities of life.So the situation isKorea is in a tough position,my parents have seenwhat life is like in the United States.They got married there.My brother was born there.And they felt that in orderto give us an opportunityto reach their aspirations for us,we had to go and come backto the United States. Now, we came back.First we went to Dallas.My father did his dental degreeall over again.And then we ended upmoving to Iowa, of all places.We grew up in Iowa.And in Iowa, we wentthrough the whole course.I went to high school, I went to college.And then one day,something that I'll never forget,my father picked me upafter my sophomore year in college,and he was driving me home,and he said, \"Jim,what are your aspirations?What do you want to study?What do you want to do?\"And I said, \"Dad,\" —My mother actually was a philosopher,and had filled us with ideasabout protest and social justice,and I said, \"Dad, I'm going to studypolitical science and philosophy,and I'm going to becomepart of a political movement.\"My father, the Korean dentist,slowly pulled the carover to the side of the road —n(Laughter) He looked back at me, and he said,\"Jim, you finish your medical residency,you can study anything you want.\"n(Laughter) Now, I've told this storyto a mostly Asian audience before.Nobody laughs. They just shake their head.Of course. (Laughter) (Applause) So, tragically,my father died at a young age,30 years ago at the age of 57,what happens to be how old I am right now,and when he died in the middleof my medical and graduate studies —You see, I actually got around itby doing medicine and anthropology.I studied both of them in graduate school. But then right about that time,I met these two people,Ophelia Dahl and Paul Farmer.And Paul and I were in the same program.We were studying medicineand at the same timegetting our PhD's in anthropology.And we began to asksome pretty fundamental questions.For people who have the great privilegeof studying medicine and anthropology —I had come from parents who were refugees.Paul grew up literallyin a bus in a swamp in Florida.He liked to call himself \"white trash.\"And so we had this opportunityand we said,what is it that we need to do?Given our ridiculouslyelaborate educations,what is the natureof our responsibility to the world?And we decided that we neededto start an organization.It's called Partners in Health.And by the way,there's a movie made about that. (Applause) There's a moviethat was just a brilliant moviethey made about itcalled \"Bending the Arc.\"It launched at Sundance this past January.Jeff Skoll is here.Jeff is one of the oneswho made it happen.And we began to thinkabout what it would take for usto actually have our aspirationsreach the levelof some of the poorestcommunities in the world. This is my very first visitto Haiti in 1988,and in 1988, we elaborateda sort of mission statement,which is we are going to makea preferential option for the poorin health.Now, it took us a long time, and wewere graduate students in anthropology.We were reading up one side of Marxand down the other.Habermas. Fernand Braudel.We were reading everythingand we had to come to a conclusionof how are we going to structure our work?So \"O for the P,\" we called it,a preferential option for the poor. The most important thingabout a preferential option for the pooris what it's not.It's not a preferential optionfor your own sense of heroism.It's not a preferential optionfor your own idea abouthow to lift the poor out of poverty.It's not a preferential optionfor your own organization.And the hardest of all,it's not a preferential optionfor your poor.It's a preferential option for the poor. So what do you do?Well, Haiti, we started building —Everyone told us, the cost-effective thingis just focus on vaccinationand maybe a feeding program.But what the Haitians wantedwas a hospital.They wanted schools.They wanted to provide their childrenwith the opportunitiesthat they'd been hearing aboutfrom others, relatives, for example,who had gone to the United States.They wanted the same kindsof opportunities as my parents did.I recognized them.And so that's what we did.We built hospitals.We provided education.And we did everything we couldto try to give them opportunities. Now, my experience really became intenseat Partners in Healthin this community, Carabayllo,in the northern slums of Lima, Peru.And in this community,we started out by really just goingto people's homes and talking to people,and we discovered an outbreak, an epidemicof multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.This is Melquiades.Melquiades was a patient at that time,he was about 18 years old,and he had a very difficult formof drug-resistant tuberculosis.All of the gurus in the world,the global health gurus,said it is not cost-effectiveto treat drug-resistant tuberculosis.It's too complicated. It's too expensive.You just can't do it. It can't be done.And in addition,they were getting angry at us,because the implication wasif it could be done,we would have done it.Who do you think you are?And the people that we fought withwere the World Health Organizationand probably the organizationwe fought with mostwas the World Bank Group. Now, we did everything we couldto convince Melquiadesto take his medicines,because it's really hard,and not once during the time of treatmentdid Melquiades's family ever say,\"Hey, you know, Melquiadesis just not cost-effective.Why don't you go onand treat somebody else?\"n(Laughter) I hadn't seen Melquiadesfor about 10 yearsand when we hadour annual meetings in Lima, Perua couple of years ago,the filmmakers found himand here is us getting together. (Applause) He has become a bit of a media starbecause he goes to the film openings,and he knows how to work an audience now. (Laughter) But as soon as we won —We did win. We won the argument.You should treatmultidrug-resistant tuberculosis —we heard the same argumentsin the early 2000s about HIV.All of the leading global healthpeople in the world saidit is impossibleto treat HIV in poor countries.Too expensive, too complicated,you can't do it.Compared to drug-resistant TB treatment,it's actually easier.And we were seeing patients like this.Joseph Jeune.Joseph Jeune also never mentionedthat he was not cost-effective.A few months of medicines,and this is what he looked like. (Applause) We call that the Lazarus Effectof HIV treatment.Joseline came to us looking like this.This is what she looked likea few months later. (Applause) Now, our argument, our battle, we thought,was with the organizationsthat kept saying it's not cost-effective.We were saying, no,preferential option for the poorrequires us to raise our aspirationsto meet those of the poor for themselves.And they said, well, that's a nice thoughtbut it's just not cost-effective.So in the nerdy waythat we have operated Partners in Health,we wrote a book against,basically, the World Bank.It says that because the World Bankhas focused so muchon just economic growthand said that governmentshave to shrink their budgetsand reduce expendituresin health, education and social welfare —we thought that was fundamentally wrong.And we argued with the World Bank.And then a crazy thing happened.President Obama nominated meto be President of the World Bank. (Applause) Now, when I went to do the vetting processwith President Obama's team,they had a copy of \"Dying For Growth,\"and they had read every page.And I said, \"OK, that's it, right?You guys are going to drop me?\"He goes, \"Oh, no, no, it's OK.\"And I was nominated,and I walked through the doorof the World Bank Group in July of 2012,and that statement on the wall,\"Our dream is a world free of poverty.\"A few months after that,we actually turned it into a goal:end extreme poverty by 2030,boost shared prosperity.That's what we do nowat the World Bank Group.I feel like I have broughtthe preferential option for the poorto the World Bank Group. (Applause) But this is TED,and so I want to sharewith you some concerns,and then make a proposal. The Fourth Industrial Revolution,now, you guys knowso much better than I do,but here's the thing that concerns me.What we hear about is job loss.You've all heard that.Our own data suggest to usthat two thirds of all jobs,currently existing jobsin developing countries,will be lost because of automation.Now, you've got to make up for those jobs.Now, one of the waysto make up for those jobsis to turn community health workersinto a formal labor force.That's what we want to do. (Applause) We think the numbers will work out,that as health outcomes get betterand as people have formal work,we're going to be able to train themwith the soft-skills trainingthat you add to itto become workersthat will have a huge impact,and that may be the one areathat grows the most. But here's the other thingthat bothers me:right now it seems pretty clear to methat the jobs of the futurewill be more digitally demanding,and there is a crisisin childhood stunting.So these are photos from Charles Nelson,who shared these with usfrom Harvard Medical School.And what these photos showon the one side, on the left side,is a three-month-old who has been stunted:not adequate nutrition,not adequate stimulation.And on the other side,of course, is a normal child,and the normal childhas all of these neuronal connections.Now, the neuronal connectionsare important,because that isthe definition of human capital.Now, we know that wecan reduce these rates.We can reduce these ratesof childhood stunting quickly,but if we don't, India, for example,with 38 percent childhood stunting,how are they going to competein the economy of the futureif 40 percent of their future workerscannot achieve educationallyand certainly we worryabout achieving economicallyin a way that will helpthe country as a whole grow. Now, what are we going to do?78 trillion dollarsis the size of the global economy.8.55 trillion dollars are sittingin negative interest rate bonds.That means that you givethe German central bank your moneyand then you pay them to keep your money.That's a negative interest rate bond.24.4 trillion dollarsin very low-earning government bonds.And 8 trillion literally sittingin the hands of rich peopleunder their very large mattresses.What we are trying to dois now use our own tools —and just to get nerdy for a second,we're talking aboutfirst-loss risk debt instruments,we're talking about derisking,blended finance,we're talking aboutpolitical risk insurance,credit enhancement —all these things that I've now learnedat the World Bank Groupthat rich people use every single dayto make themselves richer,but we haven't used aggressively enoughon behalf of the poorto bring this capital in. (Applause) So does this work?Can you actually bringprivate-sector players into a countryand really make things work?Well, we've done it a couple of times.This is Zambia, Scaling Solar.It's a box-set solutionfrom the World Bankwhere we come inand we do all the things you needto attract private-sector investors.And in this case, Zambia wentfrom having a cost of electricityat 25 cents a kilowatt-hour,and by just doing simple things,doing the auction,changing some policies,we were able to bring the cost down.Lowest bid,25 cents a kilowatt-hour for Zambia?The lowest bid was 4.7 centsa kilowatt-hour. It's possible. (Applause) But here's my proposal for you.This is from a group called Zipline,a cool company, and theyliterally are rocket scientists.They figured outhow to use drones in Rwanda.This is me launching a drone in Rwandathat delivers bloodanywhere in the countryin less than an hour.So we save lives,this program saved lives —n(Applause) This program made money for Ziplineand this program savedhuge amounts of money for Rwanda.That's what we need,and we need that from all of you.I'm asking you, carve outa little bit of time in your brainsto think about the technologythat you work on,the companies that you start,the design that you do.Think a little bit and work with usto see if we can come up with these kindsof extraordinary win-win solutions. I'm going to leave youwith one final story.I was in Tanzania,and I was in a classroom.This is me with a classroomof 11-year-olds.And I asked them, as I always do,\"What do you want to be when you grow up?\"Two raised their hands and said,\"I want to be Presidentof the World Bank.\"n(Laughter) And just like you, my own teamand their teachers laughed.But then I stopped them.I said, \"Look, I want to tell you a story.When I was born in South Korea,this is what it looked like.This is where I came from.And when I was three years old,in preschool,I don't think that George David Woods,the President of the World Bank,if he had visited Korea on that dayand come to my classroom,that he would have thoughtthat the future Presidentof the World Bankwas sitting in that classroom.Don't let anyone ever tell youthat you cannot bePresident of the World Bank.\"nNow — thank you. (Applause) Let me leave you with one thought.I came from a countrythat was the poorest in the world.I'm President of the World Bank.I cannot and I will notpull up the ladder behind me.This is urgent.Aspirations are going up.Everywhere aspirations are going up.You folks in this room, work with us.We know that we can findthose Zipline-type solutionsand help the poorleapfrog into a better world,but it won't happenuntil we work together.The future \"you\" —and especially for your children —the future youwill depend on how much careand compassion we bringto ensuring that the future \"us\"provides equality of opportunityfor every child in the world. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: You'd almost thinkpeople are surprisedto hear a talk like thisfrom the President of the World Bank.It's kind of cool.I'd encourage you to even bea little more specific on your proposal.There's many investors,entrepreneurs in this room.How will you partner with them?What's your proposal? Jim Yong Kim: Can I get nerdyfor just a second. CA: Get nerdy. Absolutely.JYK: So here's what we did.Insurance companies never investin developing country infrastructure,for example, becausethey can't take the risk.They're holding moneyfor people who pay for insurance.So what we did was a SwedishInternational Development Associationgave us a little bit of money,we went out and raised a little bitmore money, a hundred million,and we took first loss,meaning if this thing goes bad,10 percent of the loss we'll just eat,and the rest of you will be safe.And that createda 90-percent chunk, tranchethat was triple B, investment-grade,so the insurance companies invested.So for us, what we're doingis taking our public moneyand using it to deriskspecific instrumentsto bring people in from the outside.So all of you who are sittingon trillions of dollars of cash,come to us. Right? (Laughter) CA: And what you're specificallylooking for are investment proposalsthat create employmentin the developing world. JYK: Absolutely. Absolutely.So these will be, for example,in infrastructure that brings energy,builds roads, bridges, ports.These kinds of thingsare necessary to create jobs,but also what we're saying isyou may think that the technologyyou're working onor the business that you're working onmay not have applicationsin the developing world,but look at Zipline.And that Zipline thing didn't happenjust because of the qualityof the technology.It was because they engagedwith the Rwandans earlyand used artificial intelligence —one thing, Rwanda has great broadband —but these things flycompletely on their own.So we will help you do that.We will make the introductions.We will even provide financing.We will help you do that. CA: How much capitalis the World Bank willing to deployto back those kinds of efforts? JYK: Chris, you're always getting meto try to do something like this. CA: I'm trying to get you in trouble.JYK: So here's what we're going to do.We have 25 billion a yearthat we're investing in poor countries,the poorest countries.And as we investover the next three years,25 billion a year,we have got to think with youabout how to use that moneymore effectively.So I can't give you a specific number.It depends on the quality of the ideas.So bring us your ideas,and I don't think that financingis going to be the problem. CA: All right, you heard itfrom the man himself. Jim, thanks so much.JYK: Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) Aspirations are rising as never before across the world, thanks in large part to smartphones and the internet — will they be met with opportunity or frustration? As President of the World Bank Group, Jim Yong Kim wants to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. He shares how the institution is working to improve the health and financial futures of people in the poorest countries by boosting investment and de-risking development. Jim Yong Kim is leading a global effort to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. Jim Yong Kim is leading a global effort to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity."
16	"Michael Browning: engineer,innovator —inventor, really —and inspiring father.He had a passion for flight,as you can kind of sensefrom that rather dubious1970s office-leaving present.And some 40 years after that was created,a small group of us got togetherto have a go,a run at the whole challenge of flightthat inspired people for years,and do it in a very different kind of way.And that's the journey I'd liketo share with you now. The starting hypothesis was oneof the human mind and body,which, as you've seenfor the last few days here,is an amazing construct.What if you augmentedthat wonderful machinewith just the right technology?If you approach flightin that kind of real way,where could you get to? So my training partner hereback in London, Denton,is doing a much better jobof that kind of stuff than me.Guess what? It's London.The idea was that you augment that.And so, how do you augment that?Well, we bought one of these. This is a micro gas turbine.This was ground zero,so that little piece of kitproved really quite impressive,so we got two in a field.The real hero here, by the way,is, right in the background,there's a lady tending some vegetables,who does a brilliant jobof trying to ignore us for a while —n(Laughter) I think the only thingless happy is the grass,that we did probably damage quite badly. You get an idea of the thrust here,when I try to hold them horizontallyand somewhat fail.That's around 50 kilos of thrust there.We were quite impressed with that.We thought we were getting somewhere. So there's only one sensible wayto go from there:you get four. (Laughter) I have to say, I still likewatching these back. So then we thought well, let's tryand spread the load a bit.The legs are designed to take the load,so why don't we spread it out a bit?That bit was good.The harness —a nice idea but it didn't really work,as you'll see now.This whole journey was very muchabout trying things —n(Laughter) Yeah, it really didn't work, did it? Trying things and learningby failing at them most of the time.And that included failing by falling over.If you notice, we've gotfive engines here —not to be put off by the factone was in maintenance,still had a go. (Laughter) And then I pinched a fuel line.So again, good learning.We learned not to do that again. This was a blind alley. (Laughter) This was three on each arm —that was ridiculous.That was 70 kilos on each arm.Again, struck that one off. (Laughter) But we were starting to makesome really quite convincing progress,just enough to make youbelieve that maybe —maybe we could get there.You can see, look — tantalizing.The model of one on each legand two on each arm,on paper, that was enough thrust.And then we did whatI'm about to show you now,and I still love watching this one.This was our first six-second,reasonably coherent flight. (Applause) That was the point wherethis endeavor went from:\"I'm really not surethis is going to work,\"to: \"Oh my god, it does work!\"From there on we then refined it,but we carried on falling over a lot.Falling over, like I say, is definitelythe best way to learn.After a while, we startingreally refining the layout of all of this.And you'll see,that's stability and control —there's no wires there or anything —that's a combination of usrefining the technology,including with a Tupperware boxon the back for the electronicsand actually learningthe balance and control. I'm now going to save your earsfor the next short pieceand talk over it.After a while, the jet enginenoise is a bit annoying.This is only a few weeks ago.You can see the stability and controlis really quite nice,and I'd like to think this somewhatvalidates that starting hypothesis,that the human mind and body,if properly augmented in that way,can achieve some pretty cool stuff.I mean, like I said:I'm not thinking about whereI'm moving my arms at that stage.I'm looking at the objectiveof where I want to get to,and a bit like riding a bike,my arms are just doing their thing.It's a very strange experience. So where is all this headed? I'll talk over this landing —I think I land in this one. Well, I don't think anybody's goingto go down to Walmartor take the kids to schoolin any of this stuff for a while,but the team at Gravity are buildingsome awesome technologythat's going to makethis look like child's play.We're working on some thingsthat will seek to bringthis unusual experience of flightto a wider audience, beyond the eventsand displays we're doing.We're even starting to lookfor pilots two and three,if there's any volunteers. I've got this vision.It sounds audacious,but let's just stick it out there,that one day maybe we canrise up above a beach,fly up and down the coastlineof it, rise up a bit higher,with some of the safety kitwe're working on to make this achievable.Then over the horizon comesa Hercules with the ramp down.As it comes past,you start picking up speedand see if we can intercept —from the rear, not the front,that would be a mistake —and then try and land in the back.And as I say, that's a littleway off at the moment. But this is also, if I takea big step back from this,this is also a verypersonal journey for me.Back to that lovely photo,or photo in a picture.Sadly, my father tookhis own life when I was 15,and left an awful lotof unfulfilled ambition.He was a wonderful inventor,a maverick creator.And I'd just like to think,if it was possible,if he was looking down,he would be —he'd certainly be smiling at someof the things we've done here,I think.So, it's a tribute to him. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Voice-over) Richard Browning:I'm probably more nervousabout doing the demo after this.I've got a lot of thingsto get done today.Worst-case scenario,we don't get a clean start. Or we get an unplanned failurewhile I'm actually flying around.This is why we keep it very low,so the worst is I just look like an idiotand fall on my rear, as I said.So you can all enjoy that if that happens.

17	"This story begins in 1985,when at age 22,I became the World Chess Championafter beating Anatoly Karpov.Earlier that year,I played what is calledsimultaneous exhibitionagainst 32 of the world'sbest chess-playing machinesin Hamburg, Germany.I won all the games,and then it was not consideredmuch of a surprisethat I could beat 32 computersat the same time.To me, that was the golden age. (Laughter) Machines were weak,and my hair was strong. (Laughter) Just 12 years later,I was fighting for my lifeagainst just one computerin a matchcalled by the cover of \"Newsweek\"\"The Brain's Last Stand.\"No pressure. (Laughter) From mythology to science fiction,human versus machinehas been often portrayedas a matter of life and death.John Henry,called the steel-driving manin the 19th centuryAfrican American folk legend,was pitted in a raceagainst a steam-powered hammerbashing a tunnel through mountain rock.John Henry's legendis a part of a long historical narrativepitting humanity versus technology.And this competitive rhetoricis standard now.We are in a race against the machines,in a fight or even in a war.Jobs are being killed off.People are being replacedas if they had vanished from the Earth.It's enough to think that the movieslike \"The Terminator\" or \"The Matrix\"are nonfiction. There are very few instances of an arenawhere the human body and mindcan compete on equal termswith a computer or a robot.Actually, I wish there were a few more.Instead,it was my blessing and my curseto literally become the proverbial manin the man versus machine competitionthat everybody is still talking about.In the most famous human-machinecompetition since John Henry,I played two matchesagainst the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue.Nobody remembersthat I won the first match —n(Laughter) (Applause) In Philadelphia, before losing the rematchthe following year in New York.But I guess that's fair.There is no day in history,special calendar entryfor all the peoplewho failed to climb Mt. Everestbefore Sir Edmund Hillaryand Tenzing Norgaymade it to the top.And in 1997, I was stillthe world championwhen chess computers finally came of age.I was Mt. Everest,and Deep Blue reached the summit.I should say of course,not that Deep Blue did it,but its human creators —Anantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu.Hats off to them.As always, machine's triumphwas a human triumph,something we tend to forget when humansare surpassed by our own creations. Deep Blue was victorious,but was it intelligent?No, no it wasn't,at least not in the way Alan Turingand other founders of computer sciencehad hoped.It turned out that chesscould be crunched by brute force,once hardware got fast enoughand algorithms got smart enough.Although by the definition of the output,grandmaster-level chess,Deep Blue was intelligent.But even at the incredible speed,200 million positions per second,Deep Blue's methodprovided little of the dreamed-of insightinto the mysteries of human intelligence. Soon,machines will be taxi driversand doctors and professors,but will they be \"intelligent?\"I would rather leave these definitionsto the philosophers and to the dictionary.What really matters is how we humansfeel about living and workingwith these machines. When I first met Deep Bluein 1996 in February,I had been the world championfor more than 10 years,and I had played 182world championship gamesand hundreds of games againstother top players in other competitions.I knew what to expect from my opponentsand what to expect from myself.I was used to measure their movesand to gauge their emotional stateby watching their body languageand looking into their eyes. And then I sat acrossthe chessboard from Deep Blue.I immediately sensed something new,something unsettling.You might experience a similar feelingthe first time you ridein a driverless caror the first time your new computermanager issues an order at work.But when I sat at that first game,I couldn't be surewhat is this thing capable of.Technology can advance in leaps,and IBM had invested heavily.I lost that game.And I couldn't help wondering,might it be invincible?Was my beloved game of chess over?These were human doubts, human fears,and the only thing I knew for surewas that my opponent Deep Bluehad no such worries at all. (Laughter) I fought backafter this devastating blowto win the first match,but the writing was on the wall.I eventually lost to the machinebut I didn't suffer the fate of John Henrywho won but diedwith his hammer in his hand.It turned out that the world of chessstill wanted to havea human chess champion.And even today,when a free chess appon the latest mobile phoneis stronger than Deep Blue,people are still playing chess,even more than ever before.Doomsayers predictedthat nobody would touch the gamethat could be conquered by the machine,and they were wrong, proven wrong,but doomsaying has always beena popular pastimewhen it comes to technology. What I learned from my own experienceis that we must face our fearsif we want to get the mostout of our technology,and we must conquer those fearsif we want to get the bestout of our humanity.While licking my wounds,I got a lot of inspirationfrom my battles against Deep Blue.As the old Russian saying goes,if you can't beat them, join them.Then I thought,what if I could play with a computer —together with a computer at my side,combining our strengths,human intuitionplus machine's calculation,human strategy, machine tactics,human experience, machine's memory.Could it be the perfect game ever played? My idea came to lifein 1998 under the name of Advanced Chesswhen I played this human-plus-machinecompetition against another elite player.But in this first experiment,we both failed to combinehuman and machine skills effectively.Advanced Chess foundits home on the internet,and in 2005, a so-calledfreestyle chess tournamentproduced a revelation.A team of grandmastersand top machines participated,but the winners were not grandmasters,not a supercomputer.The winners were a pairof amateur American chess playersoperating three ordinary PCsat the same time.Their skill of coaching their machineseffectively counteractedthe superior chess knowledgeof their grandmaster opponentsand much greatercomputational power of others.And I reached this formulation.A weak human player plus a machineplus a better process is superiorto a very powerful machine alone,but more remarkably,is superior to a strong human playerplus machineand an inferior process.This convinced me that we would needbetter interfacesto help us coach our machinestowards more useful intelligence. Human plus machine isn't the future,it's the present.Everybody that's used online translationto get the gist of a news articlefrom a foreign newspaper,knowing its far from perfect.Then we use our human experienceto make sense out of that,and then the machinelearns from our corrections.This model is spreading and investingin medical diagnosis, security analysis.The machine crunches data,calculates probabilities,gets 80 percent of the way, 90 percent,making it easier for analysisand decision-making of the human party.But you are not going to send your kidsto school in a self-driving carwith 90 percent accuracy,even with 99 percent.So we need a leap forwardto add a few more crucial decimal places. Twenty years aftermy match with Deep Blue,second match,this sensational\"The Brain's Last Stand\" headlinehas become commonplaceas intelligent machinesmovein every sector, seemingly every day.But unlike in the past,when machines replacedfarm animals, manual labor,now they are comingafter people with college degreesand political influence.And as someonewho fought machines and lost,I am here to tell youthis is excellent, excellent news.Eventually, every professionwill have to feel these pressuresor else it will mean humanityhas ceased to make progress.We don'tget to choosewhen and wheretechnological progress stops.We cannotslow down.In fact,we have to speed up.Our technology excels at removingdifficulties and uncertaintiesfrom our lives,and so we must seek outever more difficult,ever more uncertain challenges.Machines havecalculations.We have understanding.Machines have instructions.We have purpose.Machines haveobjectivity.We have passion.We should not worryabout what our machines can do today.Instead, we should worryabout what they still cannot do today,because we will need the helpof the new, intelligent machinesto turn our grandest dreams into reality.And if we fail,if we fail, it's not because our machinesare too intelligent,or not intelligent enough.If we fail, it's becausewe grew complacentand limited our ambitions.Our humanity is not defined by any skill,like swinging a hammeror even playing chess. There's one thing only a human can do.That's dream.So let us dream big. Thank you. (Applause) We must face our fears if we want to get the most out of technology — and we must conquer those fears if we want to get the best out of humanity, says Garry Kasparov. One of the greatest chess players in history, Kasparov lost a memorable match to IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in 1997. Now he shares his vision for a future where intelligent machines help us turn our grandest dreams into reality. Garry Kasparov is esteemed by many as the greatest chess player of all time. Now he’s engaged in a game with far higher stakes: the preservation of democracy. Garry Kasparov is esteemed by many as the greatest chess player of all time.

19	"Chris Anderson:Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.It's great to have you here. Elon Musk: Thanks for having me. CA: So, in the next half hour or so,we're going to spend some timeexploring your vision for whatan exciting future might look like,which I guess makesthe first question a little ironic:Why are you boring? EM: Yeah.I ask myself that frequently.We're trying to dig a hole under LA,and this is to create the beginningof what will hopefullybe a 3D network of tunnelsto alleviate congestion.So right now, one of the mostsoul-destroying things is traffic.It affects peoplein every part of the world.It takes away so much of your life.It's horrible.It's particularly horrible in LA. (Laughter) CA: I think you've brought with youthe first visualizationthat's been shown of this.Can I show this? EM: Yeah, absolutely.So this is the first time —Just to show what we're talking about.So a couple of key thingsthat are importantin having a 3D tunnel network.First of all, you have to be ableto integrate the entranceand exit of the tunnelseamlessly into the fabric of the city.So by having an elevator,sort of a car skate,that's on an elevator,you can integrate the entranceand exits to the tunnel networkjust by using two parking spaces.And then the car gets on a skate.There's no speed limit here,so we're designing this to be ableto operate at 200 kilometers an hour. CA: How much? EM: 200 kilometers an hour,or about 130 miles per hour.So you should be ableto get from, say, Westwood to LAXin six minutes — five, six minutes. (Applause) CA: So possibly, initially done,it's like on a sortof toll road-type basis. EM: Yeah. CA: Which, I guess,alleviates some trafficfrom the surface streets as well. EM: So, I don't knowif people noticed it in the video,but there's no real limitto how many levels of tunnel you can have.You can go much further deepthan you can go up.The deepest mines are much deeperthan the tallest buildings are tall,so you can alleviate any arbitrarylevel of urban congestionwith a 3D tunnel network.This is a very important point.So a key rebuttal to the tunnelsis that if you add one layer of tunnels,that will simply alleviate congestion,it will get used up,and then you'll be back where you started,back with congestion.But you can go to anyarbitrary number of tunnels,any number of levels. CA: But people — seen traditionally,it's incredibly expensive to dig,and that would block this idea. EM: Yeah.Well, they're right.To give you an example,the LA subway extension,which is — I think it'sa two-and-a-half mile extensionthat was just completedfor two billion dollars.So it's roughly a billion dollars a mileto do the subway extension in LA.And this is not the highestutility subway in the world.So yeah, it's quite difficultto dig tunnels normally.I think we need to haveat least a tenfold improvementin the cost per mile of tunneling. CA: And how could you achieve that? EM: Actually, if you just do two things,you can get to approximatelyan order of magnitude improvement,and I think you can go beyond that.So the first thing to dois to cut the tunnel diameterby a factor of two or more.So a single road lane tunnelaccording to regulationshas to be 26 feet,maybe 28 feet in diameterto allow for crashesand emergency vehiclesand sufficient ventilationfor combustion engine cars.But if you shrink that diameterto what we're attempting,which is 12 feet, which is plentyto get an electric skate through,you drop the diameter by a factor of twoand the cross-sectional areaby a factor of four,and the tunneling cost scaleswith the cross-sectional area.So that's roughly a half-orderof magnitude improvement right there.Then tunneling machines currently tunnelfor half the time, then they stop,and then the rest of the timeis putting in reinforcementsfor the tunnel wall.So if you design the machine insteadto do continuoustunneling and reinforcing,that will give youa factor of two improvement.Combine that and that's a factor of eight.Also these machines are far from beingat their power or thermal limits,so you can jack up the powerto the machine substantially.I think you can getat least a factor of two,maybe a factor of four or fiveimprovement on top of that.So I think there's a fairlystraightforward series of stepsto get somewhere in excessof an order of magnitude improvementin the cost per mile,and our target actually is —we've got a pet snail called Gary,this is from Gary the snailfrom \"South Park,\"I mean, sorry, \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\"n(Laughter) So Gary is capable of —currently he's capableof going 14 times fasterthan a tunnel-boring machine. (Laughter) CA: You want to beat Gary. EM: We want to beat Gary. (Laughter) He's not a patient little fellow,and that will be victory.Victory is beating the snail. CA: But a lot of people imagining,dreaming about future cities,they imagine that actuallythe solution is flying cars, drones, etc.You go aboveground.Why isn't that a better solution?You save all that tunneling cost. EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.Obviously, I do rockets,so I like things that fly.This is not some inherent biasagainst flying things,but there is a challenge with flying carsin that they'll be quite noisy,the wind force generatedwill be very high.Let's just say that if something'sflying over your head,a whole bunch of flying carsgoing all over the place,that is not an anxiety-reducing situation. (Laughter) You don't think to yourself,\"Well, I feel better about today.\"You're thinking,\"Did they service their hubcap,or is it going to come offand guillotine me?\"Things like that. CA: So you've got this visionof future cities with these rich,3D networks of tunnels underneath.Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?Could you apply these tunnelsto use for this Hyperloop ideayou released a few years ago. EM: Yeah, so we've beensort of puttering aroundwith the Hyperloop stuff for a while.We built a Hyperloop test trackadjacent to SpaceX,just for a student competition,to encourage innovativeideas in transport.And it actually ends up beingthe biggest vacuum chamber in the worldafter the Large Hadron Collider,by volume.So it was quite fun to do that,but it was kind of a hobby thing,and then we think we might —so we've built a little pusher carto push the student pods,but we're going to try seeinghow fast we can make the pusher goif it's not pushing something.So we're cautiously optimisticwe'll be able to be fasterthan the world's fastest bullet traineven in a .8-mile stretch. CA: Whoa. Good brakes. EM: Yeah, I mean, it's — yeah.It's either going to smashinto tiny pieces or go quite fast. CA: But you can picture,then, a Hyperloop in a tunnelrunning quite long distances. EM: Exactly.And looking at tunneling technology,it turns out thatin order to make a tunnel,you have to —In order to seal against the water table,you've got to typically designa tunnel wall to be goodto about five or six atmospheres.So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,or near-vacuum.So actually, it sort of turns outthat automatically,if you build a tunnel that is good enoughto resist the water table,it is automaticallycapable of holding vacuum. CA: Huh. EM: So, yeah. CA: And so you could actually picture,what kind of length tunnelis in Elon's future to running Hyperloop? EM: I think there's no real length limit.You could dig as much as you want.I think if you were to do somethinglike a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,I think you'd probably wantto go underground the entire waybecause it's a high-density area.You're going undera lot of buildings and houses,and if you go deep enough,you cannot detect the tunnel.Sometimes people think,well, it's going to be pretty annoyingto have a tunnel dug under my house.Like, if that tunnel is dugmore than about three or fourtunnel diameters beneath your house,you will not be ableto detect it being dug at all.In fact, if you're ableto detect the tunnel being dug,whatever device you are using,you can get a lot of moneyfor that device from the Israeli military,who is trying to detecttunnels from Hamas,and from the US Customs and Border patrolthat try and detect drug tunnels.So the reality isthat earth is incredibly goodat absorbing vibrations,and once the tunnel depthis below a certain level,it is undetectable.Maybe if you have a very sensitiveseismic instrument,you might be able to detect it. CA: So you've starteda new company to do thiscalled The Boring Company.Very nice. Very funny. (Laughter) EM: What's funny about that? (Laughter) CA: How much of your time is this? EM: It's maybe ...two or three percent. CA: You've bought a hobby.This is what an Elon Muskhobby looks like. (Laughter) EM: I mean, it really is, like —This is basically internsand people doing it part time.We bought some second-hand machinery.It's kind of puttering along,but it's making good progress, so —nCA: So an even bigger part of your timeis being spent on electrifyingcars and transport through Tesla.Is one of the motivationsfor the tunneling projectthe realization that actually,in a world where cars are electricand where they're self-driving,there may end up beingmore cars on the roadson any given hour than there are now? EM: Yeah, exactly.A lot of people thinkthat when you make cars autonomous,they'll be able to go fasterand that will alleviate congestion.And to some degree that will be true,but once you have shared autonomywhere it's much cheaper to go by carand you can go point to point,the affordability of going in a carwill be better than that of a bus.Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.So the amount of driving that will occurwill be much greater with shared autonomy,and actually traffic will get far worse. CA: You started Teslawith the goal of persuading the worldthat electrificationwas the future of cars,and a few years ago,people were laughing at you.Now, not so much. EM: OK. (Laughter) I don't know. I don't know. CA: But isn't it true that pretty muchevery auto manufacturerhas announcedserious electrification plansfor the short- to medium-term future? EM: Yeah. Yeah.I think almost every automakerhas some electric vehicle program.They vary in seriousness.Some are very seriousabout transitioning entirely to electric,and some are just dabbling in it.And some, amazingly,are still pursuing fuel cells,but I think that won't last much longer. CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,where you can now just declare victoryand say, you know, \"We did it.\"Let the world electrify,and you go on and focus on other stuff? EM: Yeah.I intend to stay with Teslaas far into the future as I can imagine,and there are a lot of excitingthings that we have coming.Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck. CA: OK, we're going to come to this.So Model 3, it's supposedto be coming in July-ish. EM: Yeah, it's looking quite goodfor starting production in July. CA: Wow.One of the thingsthat people are so excited aboutis the fact that it's got autopilot.And you put out this video a while backshowing what that technologywould look like. EM: Yeah. CA: There's obviously autopilotin Model S right now.What are we seeing here? EM: Yeah, so this is usingonly cameras and GPS.So there's no LIDARor radar being used here.This is just using passive optical,which is essentially what a person uses.The whole road systemis meant to be navigatedwith passive optical, or cameras,and so once you solve camerasor vision,then autonomy is solved.If you don't solve vision,it's not solved.So that's why our focus isso heavily on having a vision neural netthat's very effective for road conditions. CA: Right. Many other peopleare going the LIDAR route.You want cameras plus radar is most of it. EM: You can absolutelybe superhuman with just cameras.Like, you can probably do itten times better than humans would,just cameras. CA: So the new cars being sold right nowhave eight cameras in them.They can't yet do what that showed.When will they be able to? EM: I think we're still on trackfor being able to go cross-countryfrom LA to New York by the endof the year, fully autonomous. CA: OK, so by the endof the year, you're saying,someone's going to sit in a Teslawithout touching the steering wheel,tap in \"New York,\" off it goes. EM: Yeah. CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel —by the end of 2017. EM: Yeah. Essentially,November or December of this year,we should be able to go all the wayfrom a parking lot in Californiato a parking lot in New York,no controls touched at any pointduring the entire journey. (Applause) CA: Amazing.But part of that is possiblebecause you've already got a fleetof Teslas driving all these roads.You're accumulating a huge amountof data of that national road system. EM: Yes, but the thingthat will be interestingis that I'm actually fairly confidentit will be able to do that routeeven if you change the route dynamically.So, it's fairly easy —If you say I'm going to be really goodat one specific route, that's one thing,but it should be able to go,really be very good,certainly once you enter a highway,to go anywhere on the highway systemin a given country.So it's not sort of limitedto LA to New York.We could change itand make it Seattle-Florida,that day, in real time.So you were going from LA to New York.Now go from LA to Toronto. CA: So leaving asideregulation for a second,in terms of the technology alone,the time when someonewill be able to buy one of your carsand literally just take the handsoff the wheel and go to sleepand wake up and find that they've arrived,how far away is that, to do that safely? EM: I think that's about two years.So the real trick of itis not how do you make it worksay 99.9 percent of the time,because, like, if a car crashesone in a thousand times,then you're probably still not goingto be comfortable falling asleep.You shouldn't be, certainly. (Laughter) It's never going to be perfect.No system is going to be perfect,but if you say it's perhaps —the car is unlikely to crashin a hundred lifetimes,or a thousand lifetimes,then people are like, OK, wow,if I were to live a thousand lives,I would still most likelynever experience a crash,then that's probably OK. CA: To sleep.I guess the big concern of yoursis that people may actuallyget seduced too earlyto think that this is safe,and that you'll have some horribleincident happen that puts things back. EM: Well, I think that the autonomy systemis likely to at least mitigate the crash,except in rare circumstances.The thing to appreciateabout vehicle safetyis this is probabilistic.I mean, there's some chance that any timea human driver gets in a car,that they will have an accidentthat is their fault.It's never zero.So really the key threshold for autonomyis how much better does autonomyneed to be than a personbefore you can rely on it? CA: But once you getliterally safe hands-off driving,the power to disruptthe whole industry seems massive,because at that point you've spokenof people being able to buy a car,drops you off at work,and then you let it goand provide a sort of Uber-likeservice to other people,earn you money,maybe even cover the costof your lease of that car,so you can kind of get a car for free.Is that really likely? EM: Yeah. Absolutelythis is what will happen.So there will be a shared autonomy fleetwhere you buy your carand you can chooseto use that car exclusively,you could choose to have it be usedonly by friends and family,only by other driverswho are rated five star,you can choose to share it sometimesbut not other times.That's 100 percent what will occur.It's just a question of when. CA: Wow.So you mentioned the Semiand I think you're planningto announce this in September,but I'm curious whether there'sanything you could show us today? EM: I will show youa teaser shot of the truck. (Laughter) It's alive. CA: OK. EM: That's definitely a casewhere we want to be cautiousabout the autonomy features.Yeah. (Laughter) CA: We can't see that much of it,but it doesn't look likejust a little friendly neighborhood truck.It looks kind of badass.What sort of semi is this? EM: So this is a heavy duty,long-range semitruck.So it's the highest weight capabilityand with long range.So essentially it's meant to alleviatethe heavy-duty trucking loads.And this is something whichpeople do not today think is possible.They think the truck doesn't have enoughpower or it doesn't have enough range,and then with the Tesla Semiwe want to show that no, an electric truckactually can out-torque any diesel semi.And if you had a tug-of-war competition,the Tesla Semiwill tug the diesel semi uphill. (Laughter) (Applause) CA: That's pretty cool.And short term, these aren't driverless.These are going to be trucksthat truck drivers want to drive. EM: Yes. So what will bereally fun about thisis you have a flat torque RPM curvewith an electric motor,whereas with a diesel motor or any kindof internal combustion engine car,you've got a torque RPM curvethat looks like a hill.So this will be a very spry truck.You can drive thisaround like a sports car.There's no gears.It's, like, single speed. CA: There's a great movieto be made here somewhere.I don't know what it isand I don't know that it ends well,but it's a great movie. (Laughter) EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.When I was driving the test prototypefor the first truck.It's really weird,because you're driving aroundand you're just so nimble,and you're in this giant truck. CA: Wait, you'vealready driven a prototype? EM: Yeah, I drove itaround the parking lot,and I was like, this is crazy. CA: Wow. This is no vaporware. EM: It's just like,driving this giant truckand making these mad maneuvers. CA: This is cool.OK, from a really badass pictureto a kind of less badass picture.This is just a cute housefrom \"Desperate Housewives\" or something.What on earth is going on here? EM: Well, this illustratesthe picture of the futurethat I think is how things will evolve.You've got an electric carin the driveway.If you look in betweenthe electric car and the house,there are actually three Powerwallsstacked up against the side of the house,and then that house roof is a solar roof.So that's an actual solar glass roof. CA: OK. EM: That's a picture of a real —well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.That's a real fake house. (Laughter) CA: So these roof tiles,some of them have in thembasically solar power, the ability to —nEM: Yeah. Solar glass tileswhere you can adjustthe texture and the colorto a very fine-grained level,and then there'ssort of microlouvers in the glass,such that when you're lookingat the roof from street levelor close to street level,all the tiles look the samewhether there is a solar cellbehind it or not.So you have an even colorfrom the ground level.If you were to look at itfrom a helicopter,you would be actually ableto look through and seethat some of the glass tiles havea solar cell behind them and some do not.You can't tell from street level. CA: You put them in the onesthat are likely to see a lot of sun,and that makes these roofssuper affordable, right?They're not that much more expensivethan just tiling the roof. EM: Yeah.We're very confidentthat the cost of the roofplus the cost of electricity —A solar glass roof will be lessthan the cost of a normal roofplus the cost of electricity.So in other words,this will be economically a no-brainer,we think it will look great,and it will last —We thought about havingthe warranty be infinity,but then people thought,well, that might soundlike were just talking rubbish,but actually this is toughened glass.Well after the house has collapsedand there's nothing there,the glass tiles will still be there. (Applause) CA: I mean, this is cool.So you're rolling this outin a couple week's time, I think,with four different roofing types. EM: Yeah, we're starting offwith two, two initially,and the second twowill be introduced early next year. CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?How many houses do you believecould end up having this type of roofing? EM: I think eventuallyalmost all houses will have a solar roof.The thing is to considerthe time scale hereto be probably on the orderof 40 or 50 years.So on average, a roofis replaced every 20 to 25 years.But you don't start replacingall roofs immediately.But eventually,if you say were to fast-forwardto say 15 years from now,it will be unusual to have a roofthat does not have solar. CA: Is there a mental model thingthat people don't get herethat because of the shift in the cost,the economics of solar power,most houses actually haveenough sunlight on their roofpretty much to power all of their needs.If you could capture the power,it could pretty muchpower all their needs.You could go off-grid, kind of. EM: It depends on where you areand what the house size isrelative to the roof area,but it's a fair statement to saythat most houses in the UShave enough roof areato power all the needs of the house. CA: So the key to the economicsof the cars, the Semi, of these housesis the falling priceof lithium-ion batteries,which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.In many ways, that's almostthe core competency.And you've decidedthat to really, like, own that competency,you just have to buildthe world's largest manufacturing plantto double the world's supplyof lithium-ion batteries,with this guy. What is this? EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,progress so far on the Gigafactory.Eventually, you can sort of roughly seethat there's sort ofa diamond shape overall,and when it's fully done,it'll look like a giant diamond,or that's the idea behind it,and it's aligned on true north.It's a small detail. CA: And capable of producing, eventually,like a hundred gigawatt hoursof batteries a year. EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.We think probably more, but yeah. CA: And they're actuallybeing produced right now. EM: They're in production already.CA: You guys put out this video.I mean, is that speeded up? EM: That's the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: How fast does it actually go? EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,you can't actually see the cellswithout a strobe light.It's just blur. (Laughter) CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,about what makes an exciting futureis a future where we no longerfeel guilty about energy.Help us picture this.How many Gigafactories, if you like,does it take to get us there? EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.It's not 10, it's not a thousand.Most likely a hundred. CA: See, I find this amazing.You can picture what it would taketo move the worldoff this vast fossil fuel thing.It's like you're building one,it costs five billion dollars,or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.Like, it's kind of coolthat you can picture that project.And you're planning to do, at Tesla —announce another two this year. EM: I think we'll announce locationsfor somewhere between twoand four Gigafactories later this year.Yeah, probably four. CA: Whoa. (Applause)No more teasing from you for here?Like — where, continent?You can say no. EM: We need to address a global market. CA: OK. (Laughter) This is cool.I think we should talk for —Actually, double mark it.I'm going to ask you one questionabout politics, only one.I'm kind of sick of politics,but I do want to ask you this.You're on a body nowgiving advice to a guy —nEM: Who? CA: Who has said he doesn'treally believe in climate change,and there's a lot of people out therewho think you shouldn't be doing that.They'd like you to walk away from that.What would you say to them? EM: Well, I think that first of all,I'm just on two advisory councilswhere the format consistsof going around the roomand asking people's opinion on things,and so there's like a meetingevery month or two.That's the sum total of my contribution.But I think to the degreethat there are people in the roomwho are arguing in favorof doing something about climate change,or social issues,I've used the meetings I've had thus farto argue in favor of immigrationand in favor of climate change. (Applause) And if I hadn't done that,that wasn't on the agenda before.So maybe nothing will happen,but at least the words were said. CA: OK. (Applause) So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.Last time you were here,you spoke about what seemed likea kind of incredibly ambitious dreamto develop rocketsthat were actually reusable.And you've only gone and done it. EM: Finally. It took a long time. CA: Talk us through this.What are we looking at here? EM: So this is one of our rocket boosterscoming back fromvery high and fast in space.So just delivered the upper stageat high velocity.I think this might have beenat sort of Mach 7 or so,delivery of the upper stage. (Applause) CA: So that was a sped-up —nEM: That was the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: I thought that wasthe sped-up version.But I mean, that's amazing,and several of these failedbefore you finallyfigured out how to do it,but now you've done this,what, five or six times? EM: We're at eight or nine. CA: And for the first time,you've actually reflownone of the rockets that landed. EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket boosterand then prepped it for flight againand flew it again,so it's the first reflightof an orbital boosterwhere that reflight is relevant.So it's important to appreciatethat reusability is only relevantif it is rapid and complete.So like an aircraft or a car,the reusability is rapid and complete.You do not send your aircraftto Boeing in-between flights. CA: Right. So this is allowing youto dream of this really ambitious ideaof sending many, many, many people to Marsin, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess. EM: Yeah. CA: And you've designedthis outrageous rocket to do it.Help us understandthe scale of this thing. EM: Well, visuallyyou can see that's a person.Yeah, and that's the vehicle. (Laughter) CA: So if that was a skyscraper,that's like, did I read that,a 40-story skyscraper? EM: Probably a little more, yeah.The thrust level of this is really —This configuration is about four timesthe thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket. CA: Four times the thrust of the biggestrocket humanity ever created before. EM: Yeah. Yeah. CA: As one does.EM: Yeah. (Laughter) In units of 747, a 747 is only abouta quarter of a million pounds of thrust,so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,there's 40 747s.So this would be the thrust equivalentof 120 747s, with all engines blazing. CA: And so even with a machinedesigned to escape Earth's gravity,I think you told me last timethis thing could actuallytake a fully loaded 747,people, cargo, everything,into orbit. EM: Exactly. This can takea fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,maximum passengers,maximum cargo on the 747 —this can take it as cargo. CA: So based on this,you presented recentlythis Interplanetary Transport Systemwhich is visualized this way.This is a scene you picture in, what,30 years time? 20 years time?People walking into this rocket. EM: I'm hopeful it's sort ofan eight- to 10-year time frame.Aspirationally, that's our target.Our internal targetsare more aggressive, but I think —n(Laughter) CA: OK. EM: While vehicle seems quite largeand is large by comparisonwith other rockets,I think the future spacecraftwill make this look like a rowboat.The future spaceshipswill be truly enormous. CA: Why, Elon?Why do we need to build a city on Marswith a million peopleon it in your lifetime,which I think is kind ofwhat you've said you'd love to do? EM: I think it's important to havea future that is inspiring and appealing.I just think there have to be reasonsthat you get up in the morningand you want to live.Like, why do you want to live?What's the point? What inspires you?What do you love about the future?And if we're not out there,if the future does not includebeing out there among the starsand being a multiplanet species,I find that it's incredibly depressingif that's not the futurethat we're going to have. (Applause) CA: People want to position thisas an either or,that there are so many desperate thingshappening on the planet nowfrom climate to povertyto, you know, you pick your issue.And this feels like a distraction.You shouldn't be thinking about this.You should be solving what's here and now.And to be fair, you've donea fair old bit to actually do thatwith your work on sustainable energy.But why not just do that? EM: I think there's —I look at the futurefrom the standpoint of probabilities.It's like a branchingstream of probabilities,and there are actions that we can takethat affect those probabilitiesor that accelerate one thingor slow down another thing.I may introduce something newto the probability stream.Sustainable energywill happen no matter what.If there was no Tesla,if Tesla never existed,it would have to happen out of necessity.It's tautological.If you don't have sustainable energy,it means you have unsustainable energy.Eventually you will run out,and the laws of economicswill drive civilizationtowards sustainable energy,inevitably.The fundamental valueof a company like Teslais the degree to which it acceleratesthe advent of sustainable energy,faster than it would otherwise occur. So when I think, like,what is the fundamental goodof a company like Tesla,I would say, hopefully,if it accelerated that by a decade,potentially more than a decade,that would be quite a good thing to occur.That's what I consider to bethe fundamentalaspirational good of Tesla. Then there's becoming a multiplanetspecies and space-faring civilization.This is not inevitable.It's very important to appreciatethis is not inevitable.The sustainable energy futureI think is largely inevitable,but being a space-faring civilizationis definitely not inevitable.If you look at the progress in space,in 1969 you were ableto send somebody to the moon.1969.Then we had the Space Shuttle.The Space Shuttle could onlytake people to low Earth orbit.Then the Space Shuttle retired,and the United Statescould take no one to orbit.So that's the trend.The trend is like down to nothing.People are mistaken when they thinkthat technologyjust automatically improves.It does not automatically improve.It only improves if a lot of peoplework very hard to make it better,and actually it will, I think,by itself degrade, actually.You look at great civilizationslike Ancient Egypt,and they were able to make the pyramids,and they forgot how to do that.And then the Romans,they built these incredible aqueducts.They forgot how to do it. CA: Elon, it almost seems,listening to youand looking at the differentthings you've done,that you've got this uniquedouble motivation on everythingthat I find so interesting.One is this desire to workfor humanity's long-term good.The other is the desireto do something exciting.And often it feels like you feellike you need the one to drive the other.With Tesla, you wantto have sustainable energy,so you made these super sexy,exciting cars to do it.Solar energy, we need to get there,so we need to make these beautiful roofs.We haven't even spokenabout your newest thing,which we don't have time to do,but you want to save humanity from bad AI,and so you're going to createthis really cool brain-machine interfaceto give us all infinite memoryand telepathy and so forth.And on Mars, it feelslike what you're saying is,yeah, we need to save humanityand have a backup plan,but also we need to inspire humanity,and this is a way to inspire. EM: I think the valueof beauty and inspirationis very much underrated,no question.But I want to be clear.I'm not trying to be anyone's savior.That is not the —I'm just trying to think about the futureand not be sad. (Applause) CA: Beautiful statement.I think everyone here would agreethat it is not —None of this is goingto happen inevitably.The fact that in your mind,you dream this stuff,you dream stuff that no one elsewould dare dream,or no one elsewould be capable of dreamingat the level of complexity that you do.The fact that you do that, Elon Musk,is a really remarkable thing.Thank you for helping us allto dream a bit bigger. EM: But you'll tell me if it everstarts getting genuinely insane, right? (Laughter) CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.That was really, really fantastic.That was really fantastic.

20	"The school of architecturethat I studied at some 30 years agohappened to be across the streetfrom the wonderful art gallerydesigned by the greatarchitect Louis Kahn.I love the building,and I used to visit it quite often.One day,I saw the security guard run his handacross the concrete wall.And it was the way he did it,the expression on his face —something touched me.I could see that the security guardwas moved by the buildingand that architecture has that capacityto move you.I could see it, and I remember thinking,\"Wow. How does architecture do that?\"nAt school, I was learning to design,but here — here wasa reaction of the heart.And it touched me to the core. You know, you aspire for beauty,for sensuousness, for atmosphere,the emotional response.That's the realm of the ineffableand the immeasurable.And that's what you live for:a chance to try. So in 2003, there wasan open call for designsfor the Bahá'í Temple for South America.This was the first templein all of South America.It's a continental temple,a hugely important milestonefor the Bahá'í community,because this would be the lastof the continental templesand would open the doorfor national and local temples to be builtaround the world. And the brief was deceptively simpleand unique in the annals of religion:a circular room, nine sides,nine entrances, nine paths,allowing you to come to the templefrom all directions,nine symbolizing completeness,perfection.No pulpit, no sermons,as there are no clergyin the Bahá'í faith.And in a world which is putting up walls,the design needed to express in formthe very opposite.It had to be open, welcomingto people of all faiths,walks of life, backgrounds,or no faith at all;a new form of sacred spacewith no patternor models to draw from.It was like designing one of the firstchurches for Christianityor one of the first mosques for Islam. So we live in a secular world.How do you design sacred space today?And how do you even definewhat's sacred today? I stumbled across this beautiful quotefrom the Bahá'í writings,and it speaks to prayer.It says that if you reach out in prayer,and if your prayer is answered —which is already very interesting —that the pillars of your heartwill become ashine. And I loved this ideaof the inner and the outer,like when you see someoneand you say, \"That person is radiant.\"And I was thinking, \"My gosh,how could we make somethingarchitectural out of that,where you create a buildingand it becomes alive with light?Like alabaster, if you kiss it with light,it becomes alive.And I drew this sketch,something with two layers, translucentwith structure in between capturing light.Maybe a pure form,a single form of emanationthat you could imaginewould be all domeand everything we kept makingwas looking too much like an egg. (Laughter) A blob. So you search.You all know this crazy search,letting the process take you,and you live for the surprises.And I remember quite by accidentI saw this little videoof a plant moving in light,and it made me think of movement,reach,this idea that the templecould have reach,like this reach for the divine.You can imagine alsothat movement within a circlecould mean movement and stillness,like the cosmos,something you see in many places. (Laughter) But rotation was not enough,because we needed a form.In the Bahá'í writings, it talks aboutthe temples being as perfectas is humanly possible,and we kept thinking,well, what is perfection?And I remember I stumbled into this imageof this Japanese basketand thinking our Western notionsof perfection need to be challenged,that this wonderful silhouetteof this basket, this wonkiness,and that it has the kind of dimpleof what you might imagine a shoulderor the cheekbone,and that kind of organic form.And so we drew and made models,these lines that merge at the top,soft lines,which became like draperyand translucent veils and folding,and the idea of not onlyfolding but torquing —you remember the plantand the way it was reaching.And this started to becomean interesting form,carving the base, making the entrances. And then we ended up with this.This is this temple with two layers,nine luminous veils,embodied light,soft-flowing lineslike luminescent drapery.180 submissionswere received from 80 countries,and this was selected. So we went to the next stageof how to build it.We had submitted alabaster.But alabaster was too soft,and we were experimenting,many experiments with materials,trying to think how we could havethis kind of shimmer,and we ended up with borosilicate.And borosilicate glass,as you know, is very strong,and if you break borosilicate rodsjust so and melt themat just the right temperature,we ended up with this new material,this new cast glass which took usabout two years to make.And it had this quality that we loved,this idea of the embodied light,but on the inside, we wantedsomething with a soft light,like the inner lining of a jacket.On the outside you have protection,but on the inside you touch it.So we found this tiny veinin a huge quarry in Portugalwith this beautiful stone,which the owner had keptfor seven generations in his family,waiting for the right project,if you can believe it.Look at this material, it's beautiful.And the way it lights up;it has that translucent quality. So here you see the structure.It lets the light through.And looking down,the nine wings are bound,structurally but symbolically strong,a great symbol of unity:pure geometry, a perfect circle,30 meters in section and in plan,perfectly symmetrical,like the idea of sacredness and geometry.And here you see the building going up,2,000 steel nodes,9,000 pieces of steel,7,800 stone pieces,10,000 cast glass pieces,all individual shapes,the entire superstructure all described,engineered, fabricatedwith aerospace technology,prefabricated machine to machine,robotically,a huge team effort, you can imagine,of literally hundreds,and within three percentof our $30 million budgetset in 2006. (Applause) Nine wings bound togetherforming a nine-pointed star,and the star shape moving in space,tracking the sun. So here it is. Audience: Wow!n(Applause) Hopefully, a befitting responseto that beautiful quote,\"a prayer answered,\"open in all directions,capturing the blue light of dawn,tent-like white light of day,the gold light of the afternoon,and of course, at night, the reversal:sensuous,catching the light in all kindsof mysterious ways. And the site: it's interesting;14 years ago when we made the submission,we showed the templeset against the Andes.We didn't have the Andes as our site,but after nine years, that's exactlywhere we ended up,the lines of the temple set againstnothing but pure nature,and you turn around and you getnothing but the city below you,and inside, a view in all directions,radiating gardensfrom each of the alcoves,radiating paths. Last October, the opening ceremonies —a beautiful, sacred event,5,000 people from 80 countries,a continuous river of visitors,indigenous peoplefrom all over South America,some who had never left their villages.And of course, that this templebelongs to people,the collective, of many culturesand walks of life,many beliefs,and for me, what's most importantis what it feels like on the inside;that it feel intimate,sacred,and that everyone is welcome.And if even a few who comehave the same reactionas that security guard,then it truly would be their temple.And I would love that. Thank you. (Applause) To design the Bahá'í Temple of South America, architect Siamak Hariri focused on illumination — from the temple's form, which captures the movement of the sun throughout the day, to the iridescent, luminous stone and glass used to construct it.

21	"In the next six minutesthat you will listen to me,the world will have lost three motherswhile delivering their babies:one, because of a severe complication;second, because she will be a teenagerand her body will notbe prepared for birth;but the third, only because of lackof access to basic clean toolsat the time of childbirth.She will not be alone.Over one million mothers and babiesdie every single yearin the developing world,only because of lack of accessto basic cleanlinesswhile giving birth to their babies. My journey began on a hot summer afternoonin India in 2008,when after a day of meeting womenand listening to their needs,I landed in a thatched hut with a midwife.As a mother, I was very curiouson how she delivered babies in her house.After a deep and engagingconversation with heron how she considered it a profoundcalling to do what she was doing,I asked her a parting question:Do you have the tools that you needto deliver the babies?I got to see her tool.\"This is what I use to separatethe mother and the baby,\" she said.Unsure of how to react, I held thisagricultural tool in my hand in shock.I took a picture of this,hugged her and walked away.My mind was flooded with reflectionsof my own infectionthat I had to struggle withfor a year past childbirthdespite having accessto the best medical care,and memories of my conversationwith my father,who had lost his mom to childbirth,on how he thought his lifewould be so differentif she would have beenjust next to him growing up. As a product developer,I started my process of research.I was very excited to findthat there was a product out therecalled the Clean Birth Kit.But I just couldn't buy one for months.They were only assembledbased on availability of funding.Finally, when I got my hands on one,I was in shock again.I would never use these toolsto deliver my baby, I thought.But to confirm my instincts,I went back to the women,some of whom had the experienceof using this product. Lo and behold, they hadthe same reaction and more.The women said they would ratherdeliver on a floorthan on a plastic sheetthat smeared blood all over.They were absolutely right —it would cause more infection.The thread provided was a highwayto bacterial infectionthrough the baby's umbilical cord,and the blade used was the kindthat men used for shaving,and they did not want itanywhere close to them.There was no incentive for anybodyto redesign this product,because it was based on charity.The women were neverconsulted in this process.And to my surprise, the needwas not only in homesbut also in institutional settingswith high-volume births.Situations in remote areaswere even more daunting. This had to change.I made this my area of focus.I started the design processby collecting feedback,developing prototypesand engaging with various stakeholdersresearching global protocols.With every single prototype,we went back to the womento ensure that we had a product for them.What I learned through this processwas that these women,despite their extreme poverty,placed great valueon their health and well-being.They were absolutely not poor in mind.As with all of us, they would appreciatea well-designed productdeveloped for their needs. After many iterationsworking with experts,medical health professionalsand the women themselves,I should say it was notan easy process at all,but we had a simple and beautiful design.For a dollar more than whatthe existing product was offered for,at three dollars, we were ableto deliver \"janma,\"a clean birth kit in a purse.Janma, meaning \"birth,\" containeda blood-absorbing sheetfor the woman to give birth on,a surgical scalpel, a cord clamp,a bar of soap, a pair of glovesand the first clothto wipe the baby clean.All this came packagedin a beautiful pursethat was given to the motheras a gift after all her hard work,that she carried home with prideas a symbol of prosperity. One woman reacted to this gift.She said, \"Is this really mine?Can I keep it?\"The other one said,\"Will you give me a different colorwhen I have my next baby?\"n(Laughter) Better yet, a woman expressedthat this was the first pursethat she had ever owned in her life.The kit, aside from its symbolismand its simplicity,is designed to followglobally recommended medical protocoland serves as a behavior-change toolto follow steps one after the other.It can not only be used in homes,but also in institutional settings. To date, our kit has impactedover 600,000 mothers and babiesaround the world.It's a humbling experienceto watch these numbers grow,and I cannot wait untilwe reach a hundred million. But women's health issues do not end here.There are thousands of simple issuesthat require low-cost interventions.We have facts to provethat if we invest in women and girlsand provide them with betterhealth and well-being,they will deliver healthier and wealthierand prosperous communities.We have to start by bringing simplicityand dignity to women's health issues:from reducing maternal mortality,to breaking taboos,to empowering womento take control of their own lives.This is my dream.But it is not possible to achieve itwithout engaging men and women alikefrom around the world —yes, all of you. I recently heard this lyricby Leonard Cohen:\"Ring the bells that still can ring.Forget your perfect offering.There is a crack in everything.That's how the light gets in.\"nThis is my bit of light.But we need more light.In fact, we need huge spotlightsplaced in the world of women's healthif we need a better tomorrow.We should never forget that womenare at the center of a sustainable world,and we do not exist without them. Thank you. (Applause) TED Fellow Zubaida Bai works with medical professionals, midwives and mothers to bring dignity and low-cost interventions to women's health care. In this quick, inspiring talk, she presents her clean birth kit in a purse, which contains everything a new mother needs for a hygienic birth and a healthy delivery — no matter where in the world (or how far from a medical clinic) she might be.

23	"It was just an ordinary Saturday.My dad was outside mowing the lawn,my mom was upstairs folding laundry,my sister was in her room doing homeworkand I was in the basementplaying video games.And as I came upstairsto get something to drink,I looked out the windowand realized that there was somethingthat I was supposed to be doing,and this is what I saw. No, this wasn'tmy family's dinner on fire.This was my science project.Flames were pouring out,smoke was in the airand it looked like our wooden deckwas about to catch fire.I immediately started yelling.My mom was freaking out,my dad ran around to put out the fireand of course my sisterstarted recording a Snapchat video. (Laughter) This was just the beginningof my team's science project.My team is composed of meand three other studentswho are here in the audience today.We competed in FIRST LEGO Leaguewhich is an internationalLEGO robotics competition for kids,and in addition to a robotics game,we also workedon a separate science project,and this was the projectthat we were working on. So the idea for this project all startedwhen a few months earlier,a couple of my teammatestook a trip to Central Americaand saw beaches littered with Styrofoam,or expanded polystyrene foam.And when they came backand told us about it,we really started thinking about the waysin which we see Styrofoam every day.Get a new flat-screen TV?You end up with a block of Styrofoambigger than the TV itself.Drink a cup of coffee?Well, those Styrofoam coffee cupsare sure going to add up.And where do all these items goafter their one-time use?Since there aren't any goodexisting solutions for used Styrofoam,almost all of themend up right in the landfill,or the oceans and beaches,taking over 500 years to degrade.And in fact, every year, the US aloneproduces over two billionpounds of Styrofoam,filling up a staggering25 percent of landfills. So why do we have these ghostaccumulations of Styrofoam waste?Why can't we just recycle themlike many plastics?Well, simply put, recycledpolystyrene is too expensiveand potentially contaminated,so there is very little market demandfor Styrofoam that has to be recycled.And as a result, Styrofoamis considered a nonrenewable material,because it is neither feasiblenor viable to recycle polystyrene.And in fact, many cities across the UShave even passed ordinancesthat simply ban the productionof many products containing polystyrene,which includes disposable utensils,packing peanuts, takeout containersand even plastic beach toys,all products that are very usefulin today's society.And now Francehas become the first countryto completely ban all plastic utensils,cups and plates. But what if we could keep using Styrofoamand keep benefitingfrom its cheap, lightweight, insulatingand excellent packing ability,while not having to sufferfrom the repercussionsof having to dispose of it?What if we could turn it intosomething else that's actually useful?What if we could makethe impossible possible? My team hypothesized that we could usethe carbon that's already in Styrofoamto create activated carbon,which is used in almostevery water filter today.And activated carbon worksby using very small microporesto filter out contaminantsfrom water or even air. So we started outby doing a variety of heating tests,and unfortunately, we had many failures.Literally, nothing worked.Besides my dad's grill catching on fire,most of our samplesvaporized into nothing,or exploded inside expensive furnaces,leaving a horribly sticky mess.In fact, we were so saddenedby our failures that we almost gave up. So why did we keep tryingwhen all the adultssaid it was impossible?Well, maybe it's because we're kids.We don't know any better.But the truth is, we kept tryingbecause we thought it was still possible.We knew that if we were successful,we would be helping the environmentand making the world a better place.So we kept tryingand failingand tryingand failing.We were so ready to give up. But then it happened.With the right temperatures,times and chemicals,we finally got that successful test resultshowing us that we had createdactivated carbon from Styrofoam waste.And at that moment,the thing that had been impossibleall of a sudden wasn't.It showed us that although we hadmany failures at the beginning,we were able to persevere through themto get the test results that we wanted.And moreover, not only were we ableto create activated carbonfor purifying water,but we were also ableto reduce Styrofoam waste,solving two global problemswith just one solution. So from then on, we were inspiredto take our project further,performing more teststo make it more effectiveand testing it in real world situations.We then proceeded to receive fundingfrom the NSTA's eCYBERMISSIONSTEM-in-Action programsponsored by the US Army,as well as FIRST Global Innovation Awardssponsored by XPRIZE.And we were also honoredwith the Scientific AmericanInnovator Awardfrom Google Science Fair.And using these funds, we planto file a full patent on our processand to continue to work on our project. So yes, although we startedwith catching my dad's grill on fireand failing so many timesthat we almost quit,it was well worth itwhen we look back at it now.We took a problemthat many people said was impossibleand we made it possible,and we persevered when it lookedlike nothing that we did would work.We learned that you can't have successwithout a little,or a lot, of failure. So in the future, don't be afraidif your grill goes up in flames,because you never knowwhen your idea might just catch fire. Thank you. (Applause) From packing peanuts to disposable coffee cups, each year the US alone produces some two billion pounds of Styrofoam — none of which can be recycled. Frustrated by this waste of resources and landfill space, Ashton Cofer and his science fair teammates developed a heating treatment to break down used Styrofoam into something useful. Check out their original design, which won both the FIRST LEGO League Global Innovation Award and the Scientific American Innovator Award from Google Science Fair. Ashton Cofer and his FIRST Robotics team won the Google Science Fair for developing a process to convert Styrofoam waste into activated carbon for purifying water.

27	"Today I want to talkabout the meaning of words,how we define themand how they, almost as revenge,define us. The English languageis a magnificent sponge.I love the English language.I'm glad that I speak it.But for all that, it has a lot of holes.In Greek, there's a word, \"lachesism\"which is the hunger for disaster.You know, when you seea thunderstorm on the horizonand you just find yourselfrooting for the storm.In Mandarin, they have a word \"yù yi\" —I'm not pronouncing that correctly —which means the longingto feel intensely againthe way you did when you were a kid.In Polish, they have a word \"jouska\"which is the kind ofhypothetical conversationthat you compulsivelyplay out in your head.And finally, in German,of course in German,they have a word called \"zielschmerz\"which is the dreadof getting what you want. (Laughter) Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream.I'm German myself,so I know exactly what that feels like. Now, I'm not sureif I would use any of these wordsas I go about my day,but I'm really glad they exist.But the only reason they existis because I made them up. I am the author of \"The Dictionaryof Obscure Sorrows,\"which I've been writingfor the last seven years.And the whole mission of the projectis to find holesin the language of emotionand try to fill themso that we have a way of talkingabout all those human peccadilloesand quirks of the human conditionthat we all feelbut may not think to talk aboutbecause we don't have the words to do it. And about halfway through this project,I defined \"sonder,\"the idea that we all think of ourselvesas the main characterand everyone else is just extras.But in reality,we're all the main character,and you yourself are an extrain someone else's story.And so as soon as I published that,I got a lot of response from peoplesaying, \"Thank you for giving voiceto something I had felt all my lifebut there was no word for that.\"So it made them feel less alone.That's the power of words,to make us feel less alone. And it was not long after thatthat I started to notice sonderbeing used earnestlyin conversations online,and not long after I actually noticed it,I caught it next to mein an actual conversation in person.There is no stranger feelingthan making up a wordand then seeing ittake on a mind of its own.I don't have a wordfor that yet, but I will. (Laughter) I'm working on it. I started to thinkabout what makes words real,because a lot of people ask me,the most common thingI got from people is,\"Well, are these words made up?I don't really understand.\"And I didn't really know what to tell thembecause once sonder started to take off,who am I to say what wordsare real and what aren't.And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs,who described his epiphanyas when he realized that most of us,as we go through the day,we just try to avoidbouncing against the walls too muchand just sort of get on with things.But once you realize that people —that this world was builtby people no smarter than you,then you can reach outand touch those wallsand even put your hand through themand realize that you havethe power to change it. And when people ask me,\"Are these words real?\"I had a variety of answersthat I tried out.Some of them made sense.Some of them didn't.But one of them I tried out was,\"Well, a word is realif you want it to be real.\"The way that this path is realbecause people wanted it to be there. (Laughter) It happens on collegecampuses all the time.It's called a \"desire path.\"n(Laughter) But then I decided,what people are really askingwhen they're asking if a word is real,they're really asking,\"Well, how many brainswill this give me access to?\"Because I think that'sa lot of how we look at language.A word is essentially a keythat gets us into certain people's heads.And if it gets us into one brain,it's not really worth it,not really worth knowing.Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is.A million brains, OK, now we're talking.And so a real word is one that gets youaccess to as many brains as you can.That's what makes it worth knowing. Incidentally, the realest word of allby this measure is this. [O.K.]nThat's it.The realest word we have.That is the closest thing we haveto a master key.That's the most commonlyunderstood word in the world,no matter where you are.The problem with that is,no one seems to knowwhat those two letters stand for. (Laughter) Which is kind of weird, right?I mean, it could be a misspellingof \"all correct,\" I guess,or \"old kinderhook.\"No one really seems to know,but the fact that it doesn't mattersays something abouthow we add meaning to words.The meaning is notin the words themselves.We're the onesthat pour ourselves into it. And I think, when we're all searchingfor meaning in our lives,and searching for the meaning of life,I think words havesomething to do with that.And I think if you're lookingfor the meaning of something,the dictionary is a decent place to start.It brings a sense of orderto a very chaotic universe.Our view of things is so limitedthat we have to come upwith patterns and shorthandsand try to figure outa way to interpret itand be able to get on with our day.We need words to contain us,to define ourselves. I think a lot of us feel boxed inby how we use these words.We forget that words are made up.It's not just my words.All words are made up,but not all of them mean something.We're all just sort oftrapped in our own lexiconsthat don't necessarily correlatewith people who aren't already like us,and so I think I feel us drifting aparta little more every year,the more seriously we take words. Because remember, words are not real.They don't have meaning. We do. And I'd like to leave you with a readingfrom one of my favorite philosophers,Bill Watterson, who created\"Calvin and Hobbes.\"He said,\"Creating a life that reflectsyour values and satisfies your soulis a rare achievement.To invent your own life's meaningis not easy,but it is still allowed,and I think you'll behappier for the trouble.\"nThank you. (Applause) John Koenig loves finding words that express our unarticulated feelings — like \"lachesism,\" the hunger for disaster, and \"sonder,\" the realization that everyone else's lives are as complex and unknowable as our own. Here, he meditates on the meaning we assign to words and how these meanings latch onto us. John Koenig is writing an original dictionary of made-up words.

28	"Hello, I'm Joy, a poet of code,on a mission to stopan unseen force that's rising,a force that I called \"the coded gaze,\"my term for algorithmic bias. Algorithmic bias, like human bias,results in unfairness.However, algorithms, like viruses,can spread bias on a massive scaleat a rapid pace.Algorithmic bias can also leadto exclusionary experiencesand discriminatory practices.Let me show you what I mean. (Video) Joy Buolamwini: Hi, camera.I've got a face.Can you see my face?No-glasses face?You can see her face.What about my face?I've got a mask. Can you see my mask? Joy Buolamwini: So how did this happen?Why am I sitting in front of a computerin a white mask,trying to be detected by a cheap webcam?Well, when I'm not fighting the coded gazeas a poet of code,I'm a graduate studentat the MIT Media Lab,and there I have the opportunity to workon all sorts of whimsical projects,including the Aspire Mirror,a project I did so I could projectdigital masks onto my reflection.So in the morning, if I wantedto feel powerful,I could put on a lion.If I wanted to be uplifted,I might have a quote.So I used genericfacial recognition softwareto build the system,but found it was really hard to test itunless I wore a white mask. Unfortunately, I've runinto this issue before.When I was an undergraduateat Georgia Tech studying computer science,I used to work on social robots,and one of my tasks was to get a robotto play peek-a-boo,a simple turn-taking gamewhere partners cover their faceand then uncover it saying, \"Peek-a-boo!\"The problem is, peek-a-boodoesn't really work if I can't see you,and my robot couldn't see me.But I borrowed my roommate's faceto get the project done,submitted the assignment,and figured, you know what,somebody else will solve this problem. Not too long after,I was in Hong Kongfor an entrepreneurship competition.The organizers decidedto take participantson a tour of local start-ups.One of the start-ups had a social robot,and they decided to do a demo.The demo worked on everybodyuntil it got to me,and you can probably guess it.It couldn't detect my face.I asked the developers what was going on,and it turned out we had used the samegeneric facial recognition software.Halfway around the world,I learned that algorithmic biascan travel as quicklyas it takes to downloadsome files off of the internet. So what's going on?Why isn't my face being detected?Well, we have to lookat how we give machines sight.Computer vision usesmachine learning techniquesto do facial recognition.So how this works is, you createa training set with examples of faces.This is a face. This is a face.This is not a face.And over time, you can teach a computerhow to recognize other faces.However, if the training setsaren't really that diverse,any face that deviates too muchfrom the established normwill be harder to detect,which is what was happening to me. But don't worry — there's some good news.Training sets don't justmaterialize out of nowhere.We actually can create them.So there's an opportunity to createfull-spectrum training setsthat reflect a richerportrait of humanity. Now you've seen in my exampleshow social robotswas how I found out about exclusionwith algorithmic bias.But algorithmic bias can also leadto discriminatory practices.Across the US,police departments are starting to usefacial recognition softwarein their crime-fighting arsenal.Georgetown Law published a reportshowing that one in two adultsin the US — that's 117 million people —have their facesin facial recognition networks.Police departments can currently lookat these networks unregulated,using algorithms that have notbeen audited for accuracy.Yet we know facial recognitionis not fail proof,and labeling faces consistentlyremains a challenge.You might have seen this on Facebook.My friends and I laugh all the timewhen we see other peoplemislabeled in our photos.But misidentifying a suspected criminalis no laughing matter,nor is breaching civil liberties. Machine learning is being usedfor facial recognition,but it's also extending beyond the realmof computer vision.In her book, \"Weaponsof Math Destruction,\"data scientist Cathy O'Neiltalks about the rising new WMDs —widespread, mysteriousand destructive algorithmsthat are increasingly being usedto make decisionsthat impact more aspects of our lives.So who gets hired or fired?Do you get that loan?Do you get insurance?Are you admitted into the collegeyou wanted to get into?Do you and I pay the same pricefor the same productpurchased on the same platform? Law enforcement is also startingto use machine learningfor predictive policing.Some judges use machine-generatedrisk scores to determinehow long an individualis going to spend in prison.So we really have to thinkabout these decisions.Are they fair?And we've seen that algorithmic biasdoesn't necessarily alwayslead to fair outcomes. So what can we do about it?Well, we can start thinking abouthow we create more inclusive codeand employ inclusive coding practices.It really starts with people.So who codes matters.Are we creating full-spectrum teamswith diverse individualswho can check each other's blind spots?On the technical side,how we code matters.Are we factoring in fairnessas we're developing systems?And finally, why we code matters.We've used tools of computational creationto unlock immense wealth.We now have the opportunityto unlock even greater equalityif we make social change a priorityand not an afterthought.And so these are the three tenetsthat will make up the \"incoding\" movement.Who codes matters,how we code mattersand why we code matters. So to go towards incoding,we can start thinking aboutbuilding platforms that can identify biasby collecting people's experienceslike the ones I shared,but also auditing existing software.We can also start to createmore inclusive training sets.Imagine a \"Selfies for Inclusion\" campaignwhere you and I can helpdevelopers test and createmore inclusive training sets.And we can also start thinkingmore conscientiouslyabout the social impactof the technology that we're developing. To get the incoding movement started,I've launched the AlgorithmicJustice League,where anyone who cares about fairnesscan help fight the coded gaze.On codedgaze.com, you can report bias,request audits, become a testerand join the ongoing conversation,#codedgaze. So I invite you to join mein creating a world where technologyworks for all of us,not just some of us,a world where we value inclusionand center social change. Thank you. (Applause) But I have one question:Will you join me in the fight? (Laughter) (Applause) MIT grad student Joy Buolamwini was working with facial analysis software when she noticed a problem: the software didn't detect her face — because the people who coded the algorithm hadn't taught it to identify a broad range of skin tones and facial structures. Now she's on a mission to fight bias in machine learning, a phenomenon she calls the \"coded gaze.\" It's an eye-opening talk about the need for accountability in coding ... as algorithms take over more and more aspects of our lives.

29	"I want to introduce you to somevery wise kids that I've known,but first I wantto introduce you to a camel.This is Cassie, a therapy camelvisiting one of our young patientsin her room,which is pretty magical.A friend of mine raises camelsat his ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains.He has about eight of them,and he started 30 years agobecause he thoughthorses were too mundane.John is an out-of-the-box thinker,which explains why the two of ushave been such good friendsall of our lives.Over the years, I've convinced himto shuttle those sweet furry beastsup to hang out with our sick kidsfrom time to time.Talking to John, I was surprised to learnthat camels have an averagelife expectancy of 40 to 50 years.The life expectancy of manyof the children with whom I workis less than a year. This is a pictureof the George Mark Children's House,the first pediatricpalliative respite care centerto open in the United States.I founded it in 2004,after years of working as a psychologiston pediatric intensive care units,frustrated with the undignified deathsthat so many children experiencedand their families had to endure.As I sat with families whose childrenwere at the end of their lives,I was acutely aware of our surroundings.While the elevated trainrumbled overhead on its track,quite literally the room reverberatedwith each passing train car.The lights on the wardwere fluorescent and too bright.Monitors beeped, as did the elevator,noisily announcing its arrival.These families were experiencingsome of the most excruciatingmoments of their lives,and I so wanted themto have a more peaceful placein which to say a last goodbyeto their young daughters and sons.Surely, I thought,there must be a better spotthan a hospital intensive care unitfor children at the end of their lives. Our children's houseis calm and nurturing.It's a place where familiescan stay togetherto enjoy quality time with their children,many of whom are there for respite stays,some with repeated visitsover a span of many years.We call those kids our frequent flyers.Rather than the bright,noisy quarters of the hospital,their rooms are calm and comfortable,with actual living spacesfor the families,a sanctuary of gardensand a wonderful outdoor playgroundwith special structuresfor children with physical limitations. This sweet baby Larscame to us directlyfrom a hospital intensive care unit.Imagine hearing the heartbreaking newsthat none of us would ever want to hear.His parents had been toldthat Lars had a brain anomalythat would keep him from ever swallowing,walking, talkingor developing mentally.Recognizing what little chancehe had for survival,his parents choseto focus on the quality of timethat they could spend together.They moved intoone of our family apartmentsand treasured each day that they had,which were far too few.Lars's life was brief, to be sure,mere weeks,but it was calm and comfortable.He went on hikes with his parents.The time that he spent in the poolwith our aquatic therapistlessened the seizures he was experiencingand helped him to sleep at night.His family had a peaceful placein which to both celebrate his lifeand mourn his death. It has been five yearssince Lars was with us,and in that time,his family has welcomeda daughter and another son.They are such a powerful testamentto the positive outcome that specializedchildren's hospice care can create.Their baby's physical discomfortwas well managed,giving all of them the gift of timeto be together in a beautiful place. I'm going to talk to you nowabout the elephantrather than the camel in the room.Very few people want to talk about death,and even fewer about children's death.Loss of a child,especially for those of uswho have our own children,is frightening,more than frightening,paralyzing,debilitating,impossible.But what I've learned is this:children don't stop dyingjust because we the adultscan't comprehendthe injustice of losing them.And what's more,if we can be brave enoughto face the possibility of death,even among the most innocent,we gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom. Take Crystal, for example.She was one of the first childrento come for careafter we opened our doors.She was nine when she arrived,and her neurologist expectedthat she might live another two weeks.She had an inoperable brain tumor,and her decline had really acceleratedin the week before she came to us.After settling into her room,dressed entirely in pink and lavender,surrounded by the Hello Kittyaccessories that she loved,she spent the next several dayswinning over the heartsof every staff member.Bit by bit, her condition stabilized,and then to our astonishment,she actually improved.There were a variety of factorsthat contributed to Crystal's improvementwhich we later came to callthe \"George Mark bump,\"a lovely, not uncommon phenomenonwhere children outlivethe prognoses of their illnessesif they're outside of the hospital.The calmer atmosphere of her surroundings,tasty meals that were fixedoften to accommodate her requests,the resident pets,the therapy dog and rabbitspent lots of cozy time with Crystal. After she had been with usfor about a week,she called her grandmother,and she said,\"Gee, I'm staying in a great big house,and there's room for you to come, too.And guess what?You don't have to bring any quartersbecause the washer and dryer are free.\"n(Laughter) Crystal's grandmothersoon arrived from out of town,and they spent the remainingfour months of Crystal's lifeenjoying very special days together.Some days were special because Crystalwas outside in her wheelchairsitting by the fountain.For a little girl who had spent mostof the year earlier in a hospital bed,being outside counting hummingbirdsmade for an amazing time with her grandma,and lots of laughter.Other days were specialbecause of the activitiesthat our child life specialistcreated for her.Crystal strung beads and made jewelryfor everybody in the house.She painted a pumpkinto help decorate for Halloween.She spent many excited daysplanning her tenth birthday,which of course none of usthought she would ever see.All of us wore pink boas for the occasion,and Crystal, as you can see,queen for a day,wore a sparkly tiara. One hot morning, I arrived at workand Crystal and her partnerin crime, Charlie, greeted me.With some help, they had set upa lemonade and cookie standoutside the front door,a very strategic location.I asked Crystal the priceof the cookie that I had selected,and she said, \"Three dollars.\"n(Laughter) I said that seemed a bit highfor one cookie. (Laughter) It was small.\"I know,\" she acknowledged with a grin,\"but I'm worth it.\"nAnd therein lie the words of wisdomof a young girl whose brief lifeforever impacted mine.Crystal was worth it,and shouldn't every child whose lifeis shortened by a horrific illnessbe worth it?Together, all of us todaycan offer that same specialized carethat Crystal receivedby recognizing that children'srespite and hospice careis a critical component missingfrom our healthcare landscape.It's also interesting to notethat we are able to provide this careat about one third of the costof a hospital intensive care unit,and our families don't see a bill.We are ever grateful to the supporterswho believe in this important workthat we're doing. The truth is that my colleagues and Iand the parents and other family memberswho get to experience this special wisdomare in a unique position.There are only two freestandingpediatric hospices in the United States,although I'm happy to reportthat based on our model,there are 18 othersunder various stages of development. (Applause) Still, most of the childrenwho die in the United States every yeardie in hospital rooms,surrounded by beeping machinesand anxious, exhausted adultswho have no other optionbut to say goodbyeunder those harsh, institutional lightsand among virtual strangers.For comparison's sake,the United Kingdom,which is a country with about one fifththe population of the United States,and about half the sizeof the state of California,has 54 hospice and respite centers.Why is that?I've asked myself that questionobviously many times.My best guess is that Americans,with our positive can-do attitudehold the expectationthat our medical care system will fix it,even though it may be a childhood illnessfor which there is no cure.We go to extraordinary measuresto keep children alivewhen in fact the greatest kindnessthat we might give themwould be a peaceful, pain-freeend of life.The transition from cure to careremains a challenging onefor many hospital physicianswhose training has really beenabout saving lives,not about gently guiding the patientto the end of life.The dad of a sweet babyfor whom we cared at the end of her lifecertainly captured this dichotomywhen he reflectedthat there are a lot of peopleto help you bring an infant into the worldbut very few to help you usher a baby out. So what is the magic ingredientat George Mark?The complex medical diagnosesthat bring our young patients to usmean that their liveshave often been restricted,some to a hospital bedfor long periods of time,others to wheelchairs,still others to intensive coursesof chemotherapy or rehab.We make a practiceof ignoring those limitations.Our default answer is \"yes\"and our default question is, \"Why not?\"That's why we took a young boywho wasn't going to livefor another baseball seasonto Game 5 of the World Series.That's why we have a talent showput on by the staff and kidsfor family and friends.Who wouldn't be enchanted by a young boyplaying a piano piece with his feet,because his arms are atrophied?That's why we have a prom every year.It's pretty magical.We started the promafter hearing a dad lamentthat he would never pina boutonniere on his son's tuxedo lapel.The weeks before the dance,the house is in a flurry,and I don't know who's more excited,the staff or the kids. (Laughter) The night of the eventinvolves rides in vintage cars,a walk on a red carpetinto the great room,a terrific DJand a photographer at the readyto capture pictures of these attendeesand their families.At the end of the evening this year,one of our young,delightful teenaged girls,Caitlin, said to her mom,\"That was the best nightof my whole life.\"And that's just the point,to capture the best days and nights,to abolish limitations,to have your default answer be \"yes\"and your default question be, \"Why not?\"nUltimately life is too short,whether we liveto be 85 years or just eight.Trust me.Better yet, trust Sam.It's not by pretendingthat death doesn't existthat we keep the people,especially the little people that we love,safe.In the end,we can't control how long any of us lives.What we can controlis how we spend our days,the spaces we create,the meaning and joy that we make.We cannot change the outcome,but we can change the journey.Isn't it timeto recognize that children deservenothing less than ourmost uncompromising braveryand our wildest imagination.

30	"This story starts with these two —my kids.We were hiking in the Oakland woodswhen my daughter noticeda plastic tub of cat litter in a creek.She looked at me and said,\"Daddy?That doesn't go there.\"nWhen she said that,it reminded me of summer camp.On the morning of visiting day,right before they'd let our anxiousparents come barreling through the gates,our camp director would say,\"Quick! Everyone pick upfive pieces of litter.\"You get a couple hundred kidseach picking up five pieces,and pretty soon, you've gota much cleaner camp.So I thought,why not apply that crowdsourcedcleanup model to the entire planet?And that was the inspirationfor Litterati. The vision is to createa litter-free world.Let me show you how it started.I took a picture of a cigaretteusing Instagram.Then I took another photo ...and another photo ...and another photo.And I noticed two things:one, litter became artisticand approachable;and two,at the end of a few days,I had 50 photos on my phoneand I had picked up each piece,and I realized that I was keeping a recordof the positive impactI was having on the planet.That's 50 less things that you might see,or you might step on,or some bird might eat. So I started telling peoplewhat I was doing,and they started participating.One day,this photo showed up from China.And that's when I realizedthat Litterati was morethan just pretty pictures;we were becoming a communitythat was collecting data.Each photo tells a story.It tells us who picked up what,a geotag tells us whereand a time stamp tells us when.So I built a Google map,and started plotting the pointswhere pieces were being picked up.And through that process,the community grewand the data grew.My two kids go to schoolright in that bullseye. Litter:it's blending intothe background of our lives.But what if we brought itto the forefront?What if we understood exactlywhat was on our streets,our sidewalksand our school yards?How might we use that datato make a difference? Well, let me show you.The first is with cities.San Francisco wanted to understandwhat percentage of litter was cigarettes.Why?To create a tax.So they put a couple of peoplein the streetswith pencils and clipboards,who walked around collecting informationwhich led to a 20-cent taxon all cigarette sales.And then they got suedby big tobacco,who claimed that collecting informationwith pencils and clipboardsis neither precise nor provable.The city called me and askedif our technology could help.I'm not sure they realizedthat our technologywas my Instagram account —n(Laughter) But I said, \"Yes, we can.\"n(Laughter) \"And we can tell youif that's a Parliament or a Pall Mall.Plus, every photographis geotagged and time-stamped,providing you with proof.\"Four days and 5,000 pieces later,our data was used in courtto not only defend but double the tax,generating an annual recurring revenueof four million dollarsfor San Francisco to clean itself up. Now, during that processI learned two things:one, Instagram is not the right tool —n(Laughter) so we built an app. And two, if you think about it,every city in the worldhas a unique litter fingerprint,and that fingerprint providesboth the source of the problemand the path to the solution.If you could generate a revenue streamjust by understandingthe percentage of cigarettes,well, what about coffee cupsor soda cansor plastic bottles?If you could fingerprint San Francisco,well, how about Oaklandor Amsterdamor somewhere much closer to home?And what about brands?How might they use this datato align their environmentaland economic interests? There's a block in downtown Oaklandthat's covered in blight.The Litterati community got togetherand picked up 1,500 pieces.And here's what we learned:most of that litter camefrom a very well-known taco brand.Most of that brand's litterwere their own hot sauce packets,and most of those hot sauce packetshadn't even been opened.The problem and the pathto the solution —well, maybe that brand onlygives out hot sauce upon requestor installs bulk dispensersor comes up with moresustainable packaging.How does a brand takean environmental hazard,turn it into an economic engineand become an industry hero? If you really want to create change,there's no better place to startthan with our kids.A group of fifth graders picked up1,247 pieces of litterjust on their school yard.And they learned that the mostcommon type of litterwere the plastic straw wrappersfrom their own cafeteria.So these kids wentto their principal and asked,\"Why are we still buying straws?\"And they stopped.And they learned that individuallythey could each make a difference,but together they created an impact. It doesn't matterif you're a student or a scientist,whether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi,this is a community for everyone.It started because of two little kidsin the Northern California woods,and today it's spread across the world.And you know how we're getting there?One piece at a time. Thank you. (Applause) The earth is a big place to keep clean. With Litterati — an app for users to identify, collect and geotag the world's litter — TED Resident Jeff Kirschner has created a community that's crowdsource-cleaning the planet. After tracking trash in more than 100 countries, Kirschner hopes to use the data he's collected to work with brands and organizations to stop litter before it reaches the ground. Jeff Kirschner created a global community that's eradicating litter one piece at a time. Jeff Kirschner created a global community that's eradicating litter one piece at a time."
31	"What if our plantscould sense the toxicitylevels in the soiland express that toxicitythrough the color of its leaves?What if those plants could alsoremove those toxins from the soil?Instead, what if those plantsgrew their own packaging,or were designed to only be harvestedby their owners' own patented machines?What happens when biological designis driven by the motivationsof mass-produced commodities?What kind of world would that be? My name is Ani, and I'm a designerand researcher at MIT Media Lab,where I'm part of a relatively newand unique group called Design Fiction,where we're wedged somewherebetween science fiction and science fact.And at MIT, I am lucky enoughto rub shoulders with scientistsstudying all kinds of cutting edge fieldslike synthetic neurobiology,artificial intelligence, artificial lifeand everything in between.And across campus,there's truly brilliant scientistsasking questions like,\"How can I make the world a better place?\"And part of what my grouplikes to ask is, \"What is better?\"What is better for you, for me,for a white woman, a gay man,a veteran, a child with a prosthetic?Technology is never neutral.It frames a realityand reflects a context.Can you imagine what it would sayabout the work-life balance at your officeif these were standard issueon the first day? (Laughter) I believe it's the roleof artists and designersto raise critical questions.Art is how you can seeand feel the future,and today is an excitingtime to be a designer,for all the new tools becoming accessible.For instance, synthetic biologyseeks to write biologyas a design problem.And through these developments,my lab asks, what are the rolesand responsibilitiesof an artist, designer,scientist or businessman?What are the implicationsof synthetic biology, genetic engineering,and how are they shaping our notionsof what it means to be a human?What are the implications of thison society, on evolutionand what are the stakes in this game? My own speculative design researchat the current momentplays with synthetic biology,but for more emotionally driven output.I'm obsessed with olfactionas a design space,and this project started with this ideaof what if you could takea smell selfie, a smelfie? (Laughter) What if you could takeyour own natural body odorand send it to a lover?Funny enough, I found that thiswas a 19th century Austrian tradition,where couples in courtshipwould keep a slice of applecrammed under their armpit during dances,and at the end of the evening,the girl would give the guyshe most fancied her used fruit,and if the feeling was mutual,he would wolf down that stinky apple. (Laughter) Famously, Napoleon wrotemany love letters to Josephine,but perhaps amongst the most memorableis this brief and urgent note:\"Home in three days. Don't bathe.\"n(Laughter) Both Napoleon and Josephineadored violets.Josephine wore violet-scented perfume,carried violets on their wedding day,and Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violetsevery year on their anniversary.When Josephine passed away,he planted violets at her grave,and just before his exile,he went back to that tomb site,picked some of those flowers,entombed them in a locketand wore them until the day he died. And I found this so moving,I thought, could I engineer that violetto smell just like Josephine?What if, for the rest of eternity,when you went to visit her site,you could smell Josephinejust as Napoleon loved her?Could we engineer new ways of mourning,new rituals for remembering?After all, we've engineeredtransgenic cropsto be maximized for profit,crops that stand up to transport,crops that have a long shelf life,crops that taste sugary sweetbut resist pests,sometimes at the expenseof nutritional value.Can we harness these same technologiesfor an emotionally sensitive output? So currently in my lab,I'm researching questions like,what makes a human smell like a human?And it turns out it's fairly complicated.Factors such as your diet,your medications, your lifestyleall factor into the way you smell.And I found that our sweatis mostly odorless,but it's our bacteria and microbiomethat's responsible for your smells,your mood, your identityand so much beyond.And there's all kindsof molecules that you emitbut which we only perceive subconsciously. So I've been cataloging and collectingbacteria from different sites of my body.After talking to a scientist, we thought,maybe the perfect concoction of Aniis like 10 percent collarbone,30 percent underarm,40 percent bikini line and so forth,and occasionallyI let researchers from other labstake a sniff of my samples.And it's been interesting to hearhow smell of the bodyis perceived outsideof the context of the body.I've gotten feedback such as,smells like flowers, like chicken,like cornflakes,like beef carnitas. (Laughter) At the same time, I cultivatea set of carnivorous plantsfor their ability to emitfleshlike odors to attract prey,in an attempt to kind of createthis symbiotic relationshipbetween my bacteria and this organism.And as it so happens,I'm at MIT and I'm in a bar,and I was talking to a scientistwho happens to be a chemistand a plant scientist,and I was telling him about my project,and he was like, \"Well, this soundslike botany for lonely women.\"n(Laughter) Unperturbed, I said, \"OK.\"I challenged him.\"Can we engineer a plantthat can love me back?\"And for some reason,he was like, \"Sure, why not?\"nSo we started with,can we get a plant to grow towards melike I was the sun?And so we're looking at mechanismsin plants such as phototropism,which causes the plantto grow towards the sunby producing hormones like auxin,which causes cell elongationon the shady side.And right now I'm creatinga set of lipsticksthat are infused with these chemicalsthat allow me to interact with a planton its own chemical signatures —lipsticks that cause plantsto grow where I kiss it,plants that blossomwhere I kiss the bloom. And through these projects,I'm asking questions like,how do we define nature?How do we define naturewhen we can reengineer its properties,and when should we do it?Should we do it for profit, for utility?Can we do it for emotional ends?Can biotechnology be usedto create work as moving as music?What are the thresholds between scienceand its ability to shapeour emotional landscape? It's a famous design mantrathat form follows function.Well, now, wedged somewherebetween science, design and artI get to ask,what if fiction informs fact?What kind of R&D lab would that look likeand what kind of questionswould we ask together? We often look to technology as the answer,but as an artist and designer,I like to ask, but what is the question? Thank you. (Applause) What if you could take a smell selfie, a smelfie? What if you had a lipstick that caused plants to grow where you kiss? Ani Liu explores the intersection of technology and sensory perception, and her work is wedged somewhere between science, design and art. In this swift, smart talk, she shares dreams, wonderings and experiments, asking: What happens when science fiction becomes science fact? Ani Liu explores the intersection between technology and sensory perception. Ani Liu explores the intersection between technology and sensory perception."
33	"Hi, I'm an engineerand I make robots.Now, of course you all knowwhat a robot is, right?If you don't, you'd probably go to Google,and you'd ask Google what a robot is.So let's do that.We'll go to Googleand this is what we get.Now, you can see here there arelots of different types of robots,but they're predominantlyhumanoid in structure.And they look pretty conventionalbecause they've got plastic,they've got metal,they've got motors and gears and so on.Some of them look quite friendly,and you could go upand you could hug them.Some of them not so friendly,they look like they'restraight out of \"Terminator,\"in fact they may well bestraight out of \"Terminator.\"You can do lots of really coolthings with these robots —you can do really exciting stuff. But I'd like to lookat different kinds of robots —I want to make different kinds of robots.And I take inspirationfrom the things that don't look like us,but look like these.So these are natural biological organismsand they do somereally cool things that we can't,and current robots can't either.They do all sorts of great thingslike moving around on the floor;they go into our gardensand they eat our crops;they climb trees;they go in water, they come out of water;they trap insects and digest them.So they do really interesting things.They live, they breathe, they die,they eat things from the environment.Our current robots don't really do that.Now, wouldn't it be greatif you could use some of thosecharacteristics in future robotsso that you could solvesome really interesting problems?I'm going to look at a couple of problemsnow in the environmentwhere we can usethe skills and the technologiesderived from these animalsand from the plants,and we can use themto solve those problems. Let's have a lookat two environmental problems.They're both of our making —this is man interactingwith the environmentand doing some rather unpleasant things.The first one is to dowith the pressure of population.Such is the pressureof population around the worldthat agriculture and farming is requiredto produce more and more crops.Now, to do that,farmers put more and morechemicals onto the land.They put on fertilizers,nitrates, pesticides —all sorts of thingsthat encourage the growth of the crops,but there are some negative impacts.One of the negative impacts isif you put lots of fertilizer on the land,not all of it goes into the crops.Lots of it stays in the soil,and then when it rains,these chemicals go into the water table.And in the water table,then they go into streams,into lakes, into riversand into the sea.Now, if you put allof these chemicals, these nitrates,into those kinds of environments,there are organisms in those environmentsthat will be affected by that —algae, for example.Algae loves nitrates, it loves fertilizer,so it will take in all these chemicals,and if the conditions are right,it will mass produce.It will produce massesand masses of new algae.That's called a bloom.The trouble is thatwhen algae reproduces like this,it starves the water of oxygen.As soon as you do that,the other organismsin the water can't survive.So, what do we do?We try to produce a robotthat will eat the algae,consume it and make it safe. So that's the first problem.The second problem is also of our making,and it's to do with oil pollution.Now, oil comes outof the engines that we use,the boats that we use.Sometimes tankersflush their oil tanks into the sea,so oil is released into the sea that way.Wouldn't it be niceif we could treat that in some wayusing robots that could eat the pollutionthe oil fields have produced?So that's what we do.We make robots that will eat pollution. To actually make the robot,we take inspiration from two organisms.On the right thereyou see the basking shark.The basking shark is a massive shark.It's noncarnivorous,so you can swim with it,as you can see.And the basking shark opens its mouth,and it swims through the water,collecting plankton.As it does that, it digests the food,and then it uses that energyin its body to keep moving.So, could we make a robot like that —like the basking sharkthat chugs through the waterand eats up pollution?Well, let's see if we can do that.But also, we take the inspirationfrom other organisms.I've got a picture hereof a water boatman,and the water boatman is really cute.When it's swimming in the water,it uses its paddle-like legsto push itself forward. So we take those two organismsand we combine them togetherto make a new kind of robot.In fact, because we're usingthe water boatman as inspiration,and our robot sits on top of the water,and it rows,we call it the \"Row-bot.\"So a Row-bot is a robot that rows.OK. So what does it look like?Here's some pictures of the Row-bot,and you'll see,it doesn't look anything like the robotswe saw right at the beginning.Google is wrong;robots don't look like that,they look like this. So I've got the Row-bot here.I'll just hold it up for you.It gives you a sense of the scale,and it doesn't lookanything like the others.OK, so it's made out of plastic,and we'll have a look nowat the componentsthat make up the Row-bot —what makes it really special. The Row-bot is made up of three parts,and those three parts are reallylike the parts of any organism.It's got a brain,it's got a bodyand it's got a stomach.It needs the stomach to create the energy.Any Row-bot will havethose three components,and any organismwill have those three components,so let's go through them one at a time.It has a body,and its body is made out of plastic,and it sits on top of the water.And it's got flippers on the side here —paddles that help it move,just like the water boatman.It's got a plastic body,but it's got a soft rubber mouth here,and a mouth here —it's got two mouths.Why does it have two mouths?One is to let the food go inand the other is to let the food go out.So you can see reallyit's got a mouth and a derriere,or a —n(Laughter) something where the stuff comes out,which is just like a real organism.So it's starting to looklike that basking shark.So that's the body. The second component might be the stomach.We need to get the energy into the robotand we need to treat the pollution,so the pollution goes in,and it will do something.It's got a cell in the middle herecalled a microbial fuel cell.I'll put this down,and I'll lift up the fuel cell.Here. So instead of having batteries,instead of havinga conventional power system,it's got one of these.This is its stomach.And it really is a stomachbecause you can put energy in this sidein the form of pollution,and it creates electricity. So what is it?It's called a microbial fuel cell.It's a little bitlike a chemical fuel cell,which you might havecome across in school,or you might've seen in the news.Chemical fuel cellstake hydrogen and oxygen,and they can combine them togetherand you get electricity.That's well-established technology;it was in the Apollo space missions.That's from 40, 50 years ago.This is slightly newer.This is a microbial fuel cell.It's the same principle:it's got oxygen on one side,but instead of havinghydrogen on the other,it's got some soup,and inside that soupthere are living microbes.Now, if you take some organic material —could be some waste products, some food,maybe a bit of your sandwich —you put it in there,the microbes will eat that food,and they will turn it into electricity.Not only that, but if you selectthe right kind of microbes,you can use the microbial fuel cellto treat some of the pollution.If you choose the right microbes,the microbes will eat the algae.If you use other kinds of microbes,they will eat petroleumspirits and crude oil.So you can seehow this stomach could be usedto not only treat the pollutionbut also to generate electricityfrom the pollution.So the robot will movethrough the environment,taking food into its stomach,digest the food, create electricity,use that electricityto move through the environmentand keep doing this. OK, so let's see what happenswhen we run the Row-bot —when it does some rowing.Here we've got a couple of videos,the first thing you'll see —hopefully you can see hereis the mouth open.The front mouth and the bottom mouth open,and it will stay opened enough,then the robot will start to row forward.It moves through the waterso that food goes inas the waste products go out.Once it's moved enough,it stops and then it closes the mouth —slowly closes the mouths —and then it will sit there,and it will digest the food. Of course these microbial fuel cells,they contain microbes.What you really want is lots of energycoming out of those microbesas quickly as possible.But we can't force the microbesand they generate a small amountof electricity per second.They generate milliwatts, or microwatts.Let's put that into context.Your mobile phone for example,one of these modern ones,if you use it, it takes about one watt.So that's a thousand or a million timesas much energy that that usescompared to the microbial fuel cell.How can we cope with that?Well, when the Row-bothas done its digestion,when it's taken the food in,it will sit there and it will waituntil it has consumed all that food.That could take some hours,it could take some days.A typical cycle for the Row-botlooks like this:you open your mouth,you move,you close your mouthand you sit there for a while waiting.Once you digest your food,then you can go aboutdoing the same thing again.But you know what, that lookslike a real organism, doesn't it?It looks like the kind of thing we do.Saturday night,we go out, open our mouths,fill our stomachs,sit in front of the telly and digest.When we've had enough,we do the same thing again. OK, if we're lucky with this cycle,at the end of the cyclewe'll have enough energy left overfor us to be able to do something else.We could send a message, for example.We could send a message saying,\"This is how much pollutionI've eaten recently,\"or, \"This is the kind of stuffthat I've encountered,\"or, \"This is where I am.\"That ability to send a messagesaying, \"This is where I am,\"is really, really important.If you think about the oil slicksthat we saw before,or those massive algal blooms,what you really want to dois put your Row-bot out there,and it eats up all of those pollutions,and then you have to go collect them.Why?Because these Row-bots at the moment,this Row-bot I've got here,it contains motors, it contains wires,it contains componentswhich themselves are not biodegradable.Current Row-bots containthings like toxic batteries.You can't leave those in the environment,so you need to track them,and then when they've finishedtheir job of work,you need to collect them.That limits the numberof Row-bots you can use.If, on the other hand,you have robot a little bitlike a biological organism,when it comes to the end of its life,it dies and it degrades to nothing. So wouldn't it be nice if these robots,instead of being like this,made out of plastic,were made out of other materials,which when you throw them out there,they biodegrade to nothing?That changes the wayin which we use robots.Instead of putting 10 or 100out into the environment,having to track them,and then when they die,collect them,you could put a thousand,a million, a billion robotsinto the environment.Just spread them around.You know that at the end of their lives,they're going to degrade to nothing.You don't need to worry about them.So that changes the wayin which you think about robotsand the way you deploy them. Then the question is: Can you do this?Well, yes, we have shownthat you can do this.You can make robotswhich are biodegradable.What's really interestingis you can use household materialsto make these biodegradable robots.I'll show you some;you might be surprised.You can make a robot out of jelly.Instead of having a motor,which we have at the moment,you can make thingscalled artificial muscles.Artificial muscles are smart materials,you apply electricity to them,and they contract,or they bend or they twist.They look like real muscles.So instead of having a motor,you have these artificial muscles.And you can makeartificial muscles out of jelly.If you take some jelly and some salts,and do a bit of jiggery-pokery,you can make an artificial muscle. We've also shown you can makethe microbial fuel cell's stomachout of paper.So you could make the wholerobot out of biodegradable materials.You throw them out there,and they degrade to nothing. Well, this is really, really exciting.It's going to totally change the wayin which we think about robots,but also it allows youto be really creativein the way in which you thinkabout what you can do with these robots.I'll give you an example.If you can use jelly to make a robot —now, we eat jelly, right?So, why not make something like this?A robot gummy bear.Here, I've got some I prepared earlier.There we go. I've got a packet —and I've got a lemon-flavored one.I'll take this gummy bear —he's not robotic, OK?We have to pretend.And what you do with one of theseis you put it in your mouth —the lemon's quite nice.Try not to chew it too much,it's a robot, it may not like it.And then you swallow it.And then it goes into your stomach.And when it's inside your stomach,it moves, it thinks, it twists, it bends,it does something.It could go further downinto your intestines,find out whether you've gotsome ulcer or cancer,maybe do an injection,something like that.You know that onceit's done its job of work,it could be consumed by your stomach,or if you don't want that,it could go straight through you,into the toilet,and be degraded safely in the environment.So this changes the way, again,in which we think about robots. So, we started off lookingat robots that would eat pollution,and then we're lookingat robots which we can eat.I hope this gives you some ideaof the kinds of thingswe can do with future robots. Thank you very much for your attention. (Applause) Meet the \"Row-bot,\" a robot that cleans up pollution and generates the electricity needed to power itself by swallowing dirty water.

35	"Five years ago, I had my dream job.I was a foreign correspondentin the Middle Eastreporting for ABC News.But there was a crack in the wall,a problem with our industry,that I felt we needed to fix.You see, I got to the Middle Eastright around the end of 2007,which was just around the midpointof the Iraq War.But by the time I got there,it was already nearly impossibleto find stories about Iraq on air.Coverage had dropped across the board,across networks.And of the stories that did make it,more than 80 percentof them were about us.We were missing the stories about Iraq,the people who live there,and what was happening to themunder the weight of the war. Afghanistan had alreadyfallen off the agenda.There were less than one percentof all news stories in 2008that went to the war in Afghanistan.It was the longest war in US history,but information was so scarcethat schoolteachers we spoke totold us they had troubleexplaining to their studentswhat we were doing there,when those students had parentswho were fightingand sometimes dying overseas. We had drawn a blank,and it wasn't just Iraq and Afghanistan.From conflict zones to climate changeto all sorts of issuesaround crises in public health,we were missing what I callthe species-level issues,because as a species,they could actually sink us.And by failing to understandthe complex issues of our time,we were facing certainpractical implications.How were we going to solve problemsthat we didn't fundamentally understand,that we couldn't track in real time,and where the people working on the issueswere invisible to usand sometimes invisible to each other? When you look back on Iraq,those years when wewere missing the story,were the years when the societywas falling apart,when we were setting the conditionsfor what would become the rise of ISIS,the ISIS takeover of Mosuland terrorist violence that would spreadbeyond Iraq's bordersto the rest of the world. Just around that timewhere I was making that observation,I looked across the border of Iraqand noticed there was anotherstory we were missing:the war in Syria.If you were a Middle-East specialist,you knew that Syria was that importantfrom the start.But it ended up being, really,one of the forgotten storiesof the Arab Spring.I saw the implications up front.Syria is intimately tiedto regional security,to global stability.I felt like we couldn't let that becomeanother one of the stories we left behind. So I left my big TV job to starta website, called \"Syria Deeply.\"It was designed to be a newsand information sourcethat made it easier to understanda complex issue,and for the past four years,it's been a resourcefor policymakers and professionalsworking on the conflict in Syria.We built a business modelbased on consistent,high-quality information,and convening the top minds on the issue.And we found it was a model that scaled.We got passionate requeststo do other things \"Deeply.\"So we started to work our waydown the list. I'm just one of many entrepreneurs,and we are just one of many start-upstrying to fix what's wrong with news.All of us in the trenches knowthat something is wrongwith the news industry.It's broken.Trust in the mediahas hit an all-time low.And the statistic you're seeing up thereis from September —it's arguably gotten worse.But we can fix this.We can fix the news.I know that that's true.You can call me an idealist;I call myself an industrious optimist.And I know there area lot of us out there.We have ideas for howto make things better,and I want to share three of themthat we've picked up in our own work. Idea number one:we need news that's builton deep-domain knowledge.Given the waves and waves of layoffsat newsrooms across the country,we've lost the art of specialization.Beat reporting is an endangered thing.When it comes to foreign news,the way we can fix thatis by working with more local journalists,treating them like our partnersand collaborators,not just fixers who fetch usphone numbers and sound bites.Our local reporters in Syriaand across Africa and across Asiabring us stories that we certainlywould not have found on our own.Like this one from the suburbsof Damascus, about a wheelchair racethat gave hopeto those wounded in the war.Or this one from Sierra Leone,about a local chiefwho curbed the spread of Ebolaby self-organizinga quarantine in his district.Or this one from the border of Pakistan,about Afghan refugees being forcedto return home before they are ready,under the threat of police intimidation.Our local journalists are our mentors.They teach us something new every day,and they bring us storiesthat are important for all of us to know. Idea number two:we need a kind of Hippocratic oathfor the news industry,a pledge to first do no harm. (Applause) Journalists need to be tough.We need to speak truth to power,but we also need to be responsible.We need to live up to our own ideals,and we need to recognizewhen what we're doingcould potentially harm society,where we lose track of journalismas a public service. I watched us cover the Ebola crisis.We launched Ebola Deeply. We did our best.But what we saw was a publicthat was flooded with hystericaland sensational coverage,sometimes inaccurate,sometimes completely wrong.Public health experts tell methat that actually cost us in human lives,because by sparking more panicand by sometimes getting the facts wrong,we made it harder for people to resolvewhat was actually happening on the ground.All that noise made it harderto make the right decisions. We can do better as an industry,but it requires us recognizinghow we got it wrong last time,and deciding not to go that way next time.It's a choice.We have to resist the temptationto use fear for ratings.And that decision has to be madein the individual newsroomand with the individual news executive.Because the next deadly virusthat comes aroundcould be much worseand the consequences much higher,if we do what we did last time;if our reporting isn't responsibleand it isn't right. The third idea?We need to embrace complexityif we want to make senseof a complex world.Embrace complexity —n(Applause) not treat the world simplistically,because simple isn't accurate.We live in a complex world.News is adult education.It's our job as journaliststo get elbow deep in complexityand to find new ways to make it easierfor everyone else to understand.If we don't do that,if we pretend there arejust simple answers,we're leading everyone off a steep cliff.Understanding complexityis the only way to know the real threatsthat are around the corner.It's our responsibilityto translate those threatsand to help you understand what's real,so you can be prepared and knowwhat it takes to be readyfor what comes next. I am an industrious optimist.I do believe we can fix what's broken.We all want to.There are great journalistsout there doing great work —we just need new formats.I honestly believethis is a time of reawakening,reimagining what we can do.I believe we can fix what's broken.I know we can fix the news.I know it's worth trying,and I truly believe that in the end,we're going to get this right. Thank you. (Applause) Something is very wrong with the news industry. Trust in the media has hit an all-time low; we're inundated with sensationalist stories, and consistent, high-quality reporting is scarce, says journalist Lara Setrakian. She shares three ways we can fix the news to better inform all of us about the complex issues of our time. Lara Setrakian is building innovative news platforms that stand ready to engage and explain the complexity of our world.

36	"So I'm here to talk to youabout the walkable city.What is the walkable city?Well, for want of a better definition,it's a city in which the caris an optional instrument of freedom,rather than a prosthetic device.And I'd like to talk aboutwhy we need the walkable city,and I'd like to talk abouthow to do the walkable city. Most of the talks I give these daysare about why we need it,but you guys are smart.And also I gave that talkexactly a month ago,and you can see it at TED.com.So today I want to talkabout how to do it.In a lot of time thinking about this,I've come up with what I callthe general theory of walkability.A bit of a pretentious term,it's a little tongue-in-cheek,but it's somethingI've thought about for a long time,and I'd like to sharewhat I think I've figured out. In the American city,the typical American city —the typical American cityis not Washington, DC,or New York, or San Francisco;it's Grand Rapids or CedarRapids or Memphis —in the typical American cityin which most people own carsand the temptationis to drive them all the time,if you're going to get them to walk,then you have to offer a walkthat's as good as a drive or better.What does that mean?It means you need to offerfour things simultaneously:there needs to be a proper reason to walk,the walk has to be safe and feel safe,the walk has to be comfortableand the walk has to be interesting.You need to do all fourof these things simultaneously,and that's the structure of my talk today,to take you through each of those. The reason to walkis a story I learned from my mentors,Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk,the founders of the New Urbanism movement.And I should say half the slidesand half of my talk todayI learned from them.It's the story of planning,the story of the formationof the planning profession.When in the 19th centurypeople were chokingfrom the soot of the dark, satanic mills,the planners said, hey, let's movethe housing away from the mills.And lifespans increasedimmediately, dramatically,and we like to saythe planners have been trying to repeatthat experience ever since. So there's the onsetof what we call Euclidean zoning,the separation of the landscapeinto large areas of single use.And typically when I arrivein a city to do a plan,a plan like this already awaits meon the property that I'm looking at.And all a plan like this guaranteesis that you will not have a walkable city,because nothing is locatednear anything else.The alternative, of course,is our most walkable city,and I like to say, you know,this is a Rothko,and this is a Seurat.It's just a different way —he was the pointilist —it's a different way of making places.And even this map of Manhattanis a bit misleadingbecause the red coloris uses that are mixed vertically. So this is the big storyof the New Urbanists —to acknowledgethat there are only two waysthat have been tested by the thousandsto build communities,in the world and throughout history.One is the traditional neighborhood.You see here several neighborhoodsof Newburyport, Massachusetts,which is defined as being compactand being diverse —places to live, work, shop,recreate, get educated —all within walking distance.And it's defined as being walkable.There are lots of small streets.Each one is comfortable to walk on.And we contrast that to the other way,an invention that happenedafter the Second World War,suburban sprawl,clearly not compact, clearly not diverse,and it's not walkable,because so few of the streets connect,that those streets that do connectbecome overburdened,and you wouldn't let your kid out on them.And I want to thank Alex Maclean,the aerial photographer,for many of these beautiful picturesthat I'm showing you today. So it's fun to break sprawl downinto its constituent parts.It's so easy to understand,the places where you only live,the places where you only work,the places where you only shop,and our super-sized public institutions.Schools get bigger and bigger,and therefore, furtherand further from each other.And the ratio of the sizeof the parking lotto the size of the schooltells you all you need to know,which is that no childhas ever walked to this school,no child will ever walk to this school.The seniors and juniors are drivingthe freshmen and the sophomores,and of course we havethe crash statistics to prove it. And then the super-sizingof our other civic institutionslike playing fields —it's wonderful that Westinin the Ft. Lauderdale areahas eight soccer fieldsand eight baseball diamondsand 20 tennis courts,but look at the roadthat takes you to that location,and would you let your child bike on it?And this is why we havethe soccer mom now.When I was young, I had one soccer field,one baseball diamond and one tennis court,but I could walk to it,because it was in my neighborhood. Then the final part of sprawlthat everyone forgot to count:if you're going to separate everythingfrom everything elseand reconnect itonly with automotive infrastructure,then this is what your landscapebegins to look like.The main message here is:if you want to have a walkable city,you can't start with the sprawl model.you need the bones of an urban model.This is the outcomeof that form of design,as is this.And this is somethingthat a lot of Americans want.But we have to understandit's a two-part American dream.If you're dreaming for this,you're also going to be dreaming of this,often to absurd extremes,when we build our landscapeto accommodate cars first.And the experienceof being in these places —n(Laughter) This is not Photoshopped.Walter Kulash took this slide.It's in Panama City.This is a real place.And being a drivercan be a bit of a nuisance,and being a pedestriancan be a bit of a nuisancein these places.This is a slide that epidemiologistshave been showing for some time now,n(Laughter) The fact that we have a societywhere you drive to the parking lotto take the escalator to the treadmillshows that we're doing something wrong.But we know how to do it better. Here are the two models contrasted.I show this slide,which has been a formative documentof the New Urbanism nowfor almost 30 years,to show that sprawl and the traditionalneighborhood contain the same things.It's just how big are they,how close are they to each other,how are they interspersed togetherand do you have a street network,rather than a cul-de-sacor a collector system of streets? So when we look at a downtown area,at a place that has a hopeof being walkable,and mostly that's our downtownsin America's citiesand towns and villages,we look at them and saywe want the proper balance of uses.So what is missing or underrepresented?And again, in the typical American citiesin which most Americans live,it is housing that is lacking.The jobs-to-housing balance is off.And you find that whenyou bring housing back,these other things start to come back too,and housing is usually firstamong those things.And, of course, the thingthat shows up last and eventuallyis the schools,because the people have to move in,the young pioneers have to move in,get older, have kidsand fight, and then the schoolsget pretty good eventually. The other part of this part,the useful city part,is transit,and you can have a perfectlywalkable neighborhood without it.But perfectly walkable citiesrequire transit,because if you don't have accessto the whole city as a pedestrian,then you get a car,and if you get a car,the city begins to reshape itselfaround your needs,and the streets get widerand the parking lots get biggerand you no longer have a walkable city.So transit is essential.But every transit experience,every transit trip,begins or ends as a walk,and so we have to remember to buildwalkability around our transit stations. Next category, the biggest one,is the safe walk.It's what most walkabilityexperts talk about.It is essential, but alone not enoughto get people to walk.And there are so many moving partsthat add up to a walkable city. The first is block size.This is Portland, Oregon,famously 200-foot blocks,famously walkable.This is Salt Lake City,famously 600-foot blocks,famously unwalkable.If you look at the two,it's almost like two different planets,but these places were both built by humansand in fact, the story is that whenyou have a 200-foot block city,you can have a two-lane city,or a two-to-four lane city,and a 600-foot block cityis a six-lane city, and that's a problem.These are the crash statistics.When you double the block size —this was a studyof 24 California cities —when you double the block size,you almost quadruplethe number of fatal accidentson non-highway streets. So how many lanes do we have?This is where I'm going to tell youwhat I tell every audience I meet,which is to remind youabout induced demand.Induced demand appliesboth to highways and to city streets.And induced demand tells usthat when we widen the streetsto accept the congestionthat we're anticipating,or the additional tripsthat we're anticipatingin congested systems,it is principally that congestionthat is constraining demand,and so that the widening comes,and there are all of these latent tripsthat are ready to happen.People move further from workand make other choicesabout when they commute,and those lanes fill upvery quickly with traffic,so we widen the street again,and they fill up again.And we've learned thatin congested systems,we cannot satisfy the automobile. This is from Newsweek Magazine —hardly an esoteric publication:\"Today's engineers acknowledgethat building new roadsusually makes traffic worse.\"My response to reading this was,may I please meet some of these engineers,because these are not the ones that I —there are great exceptionsthat I'm working with now —but these are not the engineersone typically meets working in a city,where they say, \"Oh, that roadis too crowded, we need to add a lane.\"So you add a lane, and the traffic comes,and they say, \"See, I told youwe needed that lane.\"This applies both to highwaysand to city streets if they're congested. But the amazing thingabout most American cities that I work in,the more typical cities,is that they have a lot of streetsthat are actually oversizedfor the congestionthey're currently experiencing.This was the case in Oklahoma City,when the mayor came runningto me, very upset,because they were namedin Prevention Magazinethe worst city for pedestriansin the entire country.Now that can't possibly be true,but it certainly is enoughto make a mayor do something about it.We did a walkability study,and what we found, lookingat the car counts on the street —these are 3,000-, 4,000-, 7,000-car countsand we know that two lanescan handle 10,000 cars per day.Look at these numbers —they're all near or under 10,000 cars,and these were the streetsthat were designatedin the new downtown planto be four lanes to six lanes wide.So you had a fundamental disconnectbetween the number of lanesand the number of carsthat wanted to use them. So it was my job to redesignevery street in the downtownfrom curb face to curb face,and we did it for 50 blocks of streets,and we're rebuilding it now.So a typical oversized street to nowhereis being narrowed, and nowunder construction,and the project is half done.The typical street like this, you know,when you do that,you find room for medians.You find room for bike lanes.We've doubled the amountof on-street parking.We've added a full bike networkwhere one didn't exist before. But not everyone has the moneythat Oklahoma City has,because they have an extractioneconomy that's doing quite well.The typical city is morelike Cedar Rapids,where they have an all four-lanesystem, half one-way system.And it's a little hard to see,but what we've done — what we're doing;it's in process right now,it's in engineering right now —is turning an all four-lanesystem, half one-wayinto an all two-lane system, all two-way,and in so doing, we're adding70 percent more on-street parking,which the merchants love,and it protects the sidewalk.That parking makes the sidewalk safe,and we're adding a much morerobust bicycle network. Then the lanes themselves.How wide are they?That's really important.The standards have changedsuch that, as Andrés Duany says,the typical roadto a subdivision in Americaallows you to seethe curvature of the Earth. (Laughter) This is a subdivisionoutside of Washington from the 1960s.Look very carefullyat the width of the streets.This is a subdivision from the 1980s.1960s, 1980s.The standards have changedto such a degreethat my old neighborhood of South Beach,when it was time to fix the streetthat wasn't draining properly,they had to widen itand take away half our sidewalk,because the standards were wider.People go faster on wider streets.People know this.The engineers deny it,but the citizens know it,so that in Birmingham, Michigan,they fight for narrower streets.Portland, Oregon, famously walkable,instituted its \"Skinny Streets\" programin its residential neighborhood.We know that skinny streets are safer.The developer Vince Graham,in his project I'On,which we worked on in South Carolina,he goes to conferences and he showshis amazing 22-foot roads.These are two-way roads,very narrow rights of way,and he shows this well-known philosopher,who said, \"Broad is the roadthat leads to destruction ... arrow is the road that leads to life.\"n(Laughter) (Applause) This plays very well in the South. Now: bicycles.Bicycles and bicyclingare the current revolution underwayin only some American cities.But where you build it, they come.As a planner, I hate to say that,but the one thing I can sayis that bicycle populationis a function of bicycle infrastructure.I asked my friend Tom Brennanfrom Nelson\Nygaard in Portlandto send me some picturesof the Portland bike commute.He sent me this. I said,\"Was that bike to work day?\"He said, \"No, that was Tuesday.\"When you do what Portland did and spendmoney on bicycle infrastructure —New York City has doubled the numberof bikers in it several times nowby painting these bright green lanes.Even automotive citieslike Long Beach, California:vast uptick in the number of bikersbased on the infrastructure.And of course, what really does it,if you know 15th Streethere in Washington, DC —please meet Rahm Emanuel'snew bike lanes in Chicago,the buffered lane, the parallel parkingpulled off the curb,the bikes between the parkedcars and the curb —these mint cyclists.If, however, as in Pasadena,every lane is a bike lane,then no lane is a bike lane.And this is the only bicyclistthat I met in Pasadena, so ... (Laughter) The parallel parking I mentioned —it's an essential barrier of steelthat protects the curb and pedestriansfrom moving vehicles.This is Ft. Lauderdale;one side of the street, you can park,the other side of the street, you can't.This is happy hour on the parking side.This is sad hour on the other side.And then the trees themselvesslow cars down.They move slower when treesare next to the road,and, of course, sometimesthey slow down very quickly.All the little details —the curb return radius.Is it one foot or is it 40 feet?How swoopy is that curb to determinehow fast the car goesand how much room you have to cross.And then I love this,because this is objective journalism.\"Some say the entrance to CityCenteris not inviting to pedestrians.\"When every aspectof the landscape is swoopy,is aerodynamic, is stream-form geometrics,it says: \"This is a vehicular place.\"So no one detail, no one speciality,can be allowed to set the stage.And here, you know, this street:yes, it will drain within a minuteof the hundred-year storm,but this poor womanhas to mount the curb every day. So then quickly, the comfortable walkhas to do with the factthat all animals seek, simultaneously,prospect and refuge.We want to be able to see our predators,but we also want to feelthat our flanks are covered.And so we're drawn to placesthat have good edges,and if you don't supply the edges,people won't want to be there.What's the proper ratioof height to width?Is it one to one? Three to one?If you get beyond one to six,you're not very comfortable anymore.You don't feel enclosed.Now, six to one in Salzburgcan be perfectly delightful.The opposite of Salzburg is Houston.The point being the parking lotis the principal problem here.However, missing teeth, those empty lotscan be issues as well,and if you have a missing cornerbecause of an outdated zoning code,then you could have a missing nosein your neighborhood.That's what we had in my neighborhood.This was the zoning code that saidI couldn't build on that site.As you may know, Washington, DCis now changing its zoningto allow sites like thisto become sites like this.We needed a lot of variances to do that.Triangular housescan be interesting to build,but if you get one built,people generally like it.So you've got to fill those missing noses. And then, finally, the interesting walk:signs of humanity.We are among the social primates.Nothing interests us morethan other people.We want signs of people.So the perfect one-to-one ratio,it's a great thing.This is Grand Rapids,a very walkable city,but nobody walks on this streetthat connects the twobest hotels together,because if on the left,you have an exposed parking deck,and on the right,you have a conference facilitythat was apparently designedin admiration for that parking deck,then you don't attract that many people.Mayor Joe Riley, in his 10th term,Mayor of Charleston, South Carolina,taught us it only takes25 feet of buildingto hide 250 feet of garage.This one I call the Chia Pet Garage.It's in South Beach.That active ground floor. I want to end with this projectthat I love to show.It's by Meleca Architects.It's in Columbus, Ohio.To the left is the convention centerneighborhood, full of pedestrians.To the right is the Short Northneighborhood — ethnic,great restaurants,great shops, struggling.It wasn't doing very wellbecause this was the bridge,and no one was walkingfrom the convention centerinto that neighborhood.Well, when they rebuilt the highway,they added an extra 80 feet to the bridge.Sorry — they rebuilt the bridgeover the highway.The city paid 1.9 million dollars,they gave the site to a developer,the developer built thisand now the Short Northhas come back to life.And everyone says, the newspapers,not the planning magazines,the newspapers sayit's because of that bridge. So that's it. That's the generaltheory of walkability.Think about your own cities.Think about how you can apply it.You've got to do all four things at once.So find those placeswhere you have most of themand fix what you can,fix what still needs fixingin those places. I really appreciate your attention,and thank you for coming today. (Applause) Freedom from cars, freedom from sprawl, freedom to walk your city! City planner Jeff Speck shares his \"general theory of walkability\" — four planning principles to transform sprawling cities of six-lane highways and 600-foot blocks into safe, walkable oases full of bike lanes and tree-lined streets.

38	"How many of you are creatives,designers, engineers,entrepreneurs, artists,or maybe you just havea really big imagination?Show of hands? (Cheers) That's most of you.I have some news for us creatives.Over the course of the next 20 years,more will change aroundthe way we do our workthan has happened in the last 2,000.In fact, I think we're at the dawnof a new age in human history. Now, there have been four major historicaleras defined by the way we work.The Hunter-Gatherer Agelasted several million years.And then the Agricultural Agelasted several thousand years.The Industrial Age lasteda couple of centuries.And now the Information Agehas lasted just a few decades.And now today, we're on the cuspof our next great era as a species. Welcome to the Augmented Age.In this new era, your natural humancapabilities are going to be augmentedby computational systemsthat help you think,robotic systems that help you make,and a digital nervous systemthat connects you to the worldfar beyond your natural senses.Let's start with cognitive augmentation.How many of you are augmented cyborgs? (Laughter) I would actually arguethat we're already augmented.Imagine you're at a party,and somebody asks you a questionthat you don't know the answer to.If you have one of these,in a few seconds, you can know the answer.But this is just a primitive beginning.Even Siri is just a passive tool.In fact, for the lastthree-and-a-half million years,the tools that we've hadhave been completely passive.They do exactly what we tell themand nothing more.Our very first tool only cutwhere we struck it.The chisel only carveswhere the artist points it.And even our most advanced toolsdo nothing without our explicit direction.In fact, to date, and thisis something that frustrates me,we've always been limitedby this need to manuallypush our wills into our tools —like, manual,literally using our hands,even with computers.But I'm more like Scotty in \"Star Trek.\"n(Laughter) I want to have a conversationwith a computer.I want to say, \"Computer,let's design a car,\"and the computer shows me a car.And I say, \"No, more fast-looking,and less German,\"and bang, the computer shows me an option. (Laughter) That conversation might bea little ways off,probably less than many of us think,but right now,we're working on it.Tools are making this leapfrom being passive to being generative.Generative design toolsuse a computer and algorithmsto synthesize geometryto come up with new designsall by themselves.All it needs are your goalsand your constraints. I'll give you an example.In the case of this aerial drone chassis,all you would need to dois tell it something like,it has four propellers,you want it to beas lightweight as possible,and you need it to beaerodynamically efficient.Then what the computer doesis it explores the entire solution space:every single possibility that solvesand meets your criteria —millions of them.It takes big computers to do this.But it comes back to us with designsthat we, by ourselves,never could've imagined.And the computer's coming upwith this stuff all by itself —no one ever drew anything,and it started completely from scratch.And by the way, it's no accidentthat the drone body looks just likethe pelvis of a flying squirrel. (Laughter) It's because the algorithmsare designed to workthe same way evolution does. What's exciting is we're startingto see this technologyout in the real world.We've been working with Airbusfor a couple of yearson this concept plane for the future.It's a ways out still.But just recently we useda generative-design AIto come up with this.This is a 3D-printed cabin partitionthat's been designed by a computer.It's stronger than the originalyet half the weight,and it will be flyingin the Airbus A320 later this year.So computers can now generate;they can come up with their own solutionsto our well-defined problems.But they're not intuitive.They still have to start from scratchevery single time,and that's because they never learn.Unlike Maggie. (Laughter) Maggie's actually smarterthan our most advanced design tools.What do I mean by that?If her owner picks up that leash,Maggie knows with a fairdegree of certaintyit's time to go for a walk.And how did she learn?Well, every time the owner picked upthe leash, they went for a walk.And Maggie did three things:she had to pay attention,she had to remember what happenedand she had to retain and createa pattern in her mind. Interestingly, that's exactly whatcomputer scientistshave been trying to get AIs to dofor the last 60 or so years.Back in 1952,they built this computerthat could play Tic-Tac-Toe.Big deal.Then 45 years later, in 1997,Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess.2011, Watson beats these twohumans at Jeopardy,which is much harder for a computerto play than chess is.In fact, rather than workingfrom predefined recipes,Watson had to use reasoningto overcome his human opponents.And then a couple of weeks ago,DeepMind's AlphaGo beatsthe world's best human at Go,which is the most difficultgame that we have.In fact, in Go, there are morepossible movesthan there are atoms in the universe.So in order to win,what AlphaGo had to dowas develop intuition.And in fact, at some points,AlphaGo's programmers didn't understandwhy AlphaGo was doing what it was doing. And things are moving really fast.I mean, consider —in the space of a human lifetime,computers have gone from a child's gameto what's recognized as the pinnacleof strategic thought.What's basically happeningis computers are goingfrom being like Spockto being a lot more like Kirk. (Laughter) Right? From pure logic to intuition.Would you cross this bridge?Most of you are saying, \"Oh, hell no!\"n(Laughter) And you arrived at that decisionin a split second.You just sort of knewthat bridge was unsafe.And that's exactly the kind of intuitionthat our deep-learning systemsare starting to develop right now.Very soon, you'll literally be ableto show something you've made,you've designed,to a computer,and it will look at it and say,\"Sorry, homie, that'll never work.You have to try again.\"Or you could ask it if peopleare going to like your next song,or your next flavor of ice cream.Or, much more importantly,you could work with a computerto solve a problemthat we've never faced before.For instance, climate change.We're not doing a verygood job on our own,we could certainly useall the help we can get.That's what I'm talking about,technology amplifyingour cognitive abilitiesso we can imagine and design thingsthat were simply out of our reachas plain old un-augmented humans. So what about makingall of this crazy new stuffthat we're going to invent and design?I think the era of human augmentationis as much about the physical worldas it is about the virtual,intellectual realm.How will technology augment us?In the physical world, robotic systems.OK, there's certainly a fearthat robots are going to takejobs away from humans,and that is true in certain sectors.But I'm much more interested in this ideathat humans and robots working togetherare going to augment each other,and start to inhabit a new space. This is our applied research labin San Francisco,where one of our areas of focusis advanced robotics,specifically, human-robot collaboration.And this is Bishop, one of our robots.As an experiment, we set it upto help a person working in constructiondoing repetitive tasks —tasks like cutting out holes for outletsor light switches in drywall. (Laughter) So, Bishop's human partnercan tell what to do in plain Englishand with simple gestures,kind of like talking to a dog,and then Bishop executeson those instructionswith perfect precision.We're using the humanfor what the human is good at:awareness, perception and decision making.And we're using the robotfor what it's good at:precision and repetitiveness. Here's another cool projectthat Bishop worked on.The goal of this project,which we called the HIVE,was to prototype the experienceof humans, computers and robotsall working together to solvea highly complex design problem.The humans acted as labor.They cruised around the construction site,they manipulated the bamboo —which, by the way,because it's a non-isomorphic material,is super hard for robots to deal with.But then the robotsdid this fiber winding,which was almost impossiblefor a human to do.And then we had an AIthat was controlling everything.It was telling the humans what to do,telling the robots what to doand keeping track of thousandsof individual components.What's interesting is,building this pavilionwas simply not possiblewithout human, robot and AIaugmenting each other. OK, I'll share one more project.This one's a little bit crazy.We're working with Amsterdam-based artistJoris Laarman and his team at MX3Dto generatively designand robotically printthe world's first autonomouslymanufactured bridge.So, Joris and an AI are designingthis thing right now, as we speak,in Amsterdam.And when they're done,we're going to hit \"Go,\"and robots will start 3D printingin stainless steel,and then they're going to keep printing,without human intervention,until the bridge is finished. So, as computers are goingto augment our abilityto imagine and design new stuff,robotic systems are going to help usbuild and make thingsthat we've never been able to make before.But what about our abilityto sense and control these things?What about a nervous systemfor the things that we make? Our nervous system,the human nervous system,tells us everythingthat's going on around us.But the nervous system of the thingswe make is rudimentary at best.For instance, a car doesn't tellthe city's public works departmentthat it just hit a pothole at the cornerof Broadway and Morrison.A building doesn't tell its designerswhether or not the people insidelike being there,and the toy manufacturer doesn't knowif a toy is actually being played with —how and where and whetheror not it's any fun.Look, I'm sure that the designersimagined this lifestyle for Barbiewhen they designed her. (Laughter) But what if it turns out that Barbie'sactually really lonely? (Laughter) If the designers had knownwhat was really happeningin the real worldwith their designs — the road,the building, Barbie —they could've used that knowledgeto create an experiencethat was better for the user.What's missing is a nervous systemconnecting us to all of the thingsthat we design, make and use.What if all of you had that kindof information flowing to youfrom the things you createin the real world?With all of the stuff we make,we spend a tremendous amountof money and energy —in fact, last year,about two trillion dollars —convincing people to buythe things we've made.But if you had this connectionto the things that you design and createafter they're out in the real world,after they've been soldor launched or whatever,we could actually change that,and go from making people want our stuff,to just making stuff that peoplewant in the first place. The good news is, we're workingon digital nervous systemsthat connect us to the things we design.We're working on one projectwith a couple of guys down in Los Angelescalled the Bandito Brothersand their team.And one of the things these guys dois build insane carsthat do absolutely insane things.These guys are crazy —n(Laughter) in the best way.And what we're doing with themis taking a traditional race-car chassisand giving it a nervous system. So we instrumented itwith dozens of sensors,put a world-class driver behind the wheel,took it out to the desertand drove the hell out of it for a week.And the car's nervous systemcaptured everythingthat was happening to the car.We captured four billion data points;all of the forcesthat it was subjected to.And then we did something crazy.We took all of that data,and plugged it into a generative-design AIwe call \"Dreamcatcher.\"So what do get when you givea design tool a nervous system,and you ask it to build youthe ultimate car chassis?You get this.This is something that a humancould never have designed.Except a human did design this,but it was a human that was augmentedby a generative-design AI,a digital nervous systemand robots that can actuallyfabricate something like this. So if this is the future,the Augmented Age,and we're going to be augmentedcognitively, physically and perceptually,what will that look like?What is this wonderland going to be like? I think we're going to see a worldwhere we're movingfrom things that are fabricatedto things that are farmed.Where we're moving from thingsthat are constructedto that which is grown.We're going to move from being isolatedto being connected.And we'll move away from extractionto embrace aggregation.I also think we'll shiftfrom craving obedience from our thingsto valuing autonomy. Thanks to our augmented capabilities,our world is going to change dramatically.We're going to have a worldwith more variety, more connectedness,more dynamism, more complexity,more adaptability and, of course,more beauty.The shape of things to comewill be unlike anythingwe've ever seen before.Why?Because what will be shaping those thingsis this new partnershipbetween technology, nature and humanity.That, to me, is a futurewell worth looking forward to. Thank you all so much. (Applause) What do you get when you give a design tool a digital nervous system? Computers that improve our ability to think and imagine, and robotic systems that come up with (and build) radical new designs for bridges, cars, drones and much more — all by themselves. Take a tour of the Augmented Age with futurist Maurice Conti and preview a time when robots and humans will work side-by-side to accomplish things neither could do alone.

39	"So many of you have probably seenthe movie \"The Martian.\"But for those of you who did not,it's a movie about an astronautwho is stranded on Mars,and his efforts to stay aliveuntil the Earth can send a rescue missionto bring him back to Earth.Gladly, they do re-establish communicationwith the character,astronaut Watney, at some pointso that he's not as aloneon Mars until he can be rescued.So while you're watching the movie,or even if you haven't,when you think about Mars,you're probably thinking abouthow far away it is and how distant. And, what might nothave occurred to you is,what are the logistics really likeof working on another planet —of living on two planetswhen there are people on the Earthand there are rovers or people on Mars?So think about when you have friends,families and co-workersin California, on the West Coastor in other parts of the world.When you're tryingto communicate with them,one of the thingsyou probably first think about is:wait, what time is it in California?Will I wake them up? Is it OK to call?So even if you're interactingwith colleagues who are in Europe,you're immediately thinking about:What does it take to coordinatecommunication when people are far away?So we don't have people on Marsright now, but we do have rovers.And actually right now, on Curiosity,it is 6:10 in the morning.So, 6:10 in the morning on Mars.We have four rovers on Mars.The United States has put four roverson Mars since the mid-1990s,and I have been privileged enoughto work on three of them.So, I am a spacecraft engineer,a spacecraft operations engineer,at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratoryin Los Angeles, California.And these roversare our robotic emissaries.So, they are our eyes and our ears,and they see the planet for usuntil we can send people.So we learn how to operateon other planets through these rovers.So before we send people, we send robots.So the reason there's a time differenceon Mars right now,from the time that we're atis because the Martian dayis longer than the Earth day.Our Earth day is 24 hours,because that's how long it takesthe Earth to rotate,how long it takes to go around once.So our day is 24 hours.It takes Mars 24 hours and approximately40 minutes to rotate once.So that means that the Martian dayis 40 minutes longer than the Earth day.So teams of people who are operatingthe rovers on Mars, like this one,what we are doing is we are livingon Earth, but working on Mars.So we have to think as if we are actuallyon Mars with the rover.Our job, the job of this team,of which I'm a part of,is to send commands to the roverto tell it what to do the next day.To tell it to drive or drillor tell her whatever she's supposed to do.So while she's sleeping —and the rover does sleep at nightbecause she needsto recharge her batteriesand she needs to weatherthe cold Martian night.And so she sleeps.So while she sleeps, we workon her program for the next day.So I work the Martian night shift.(Laughter)So in order to come to work on the Earthat the same time every day on Mars —like, let's say I need to beat work at 5:00 p.m.,this team needs to be at workat 5:00 p.m. Mars time every day,then we have to come to workon the Earth 40 minutes later every day,in order to stay in sync with Mars.That's like moving a time zone every day.So one day you come in at 8:00,the next day 40 minutes later at 8:40,the next day 40 minutes later at 9:20,the next day at 10:00.So you keep moving 40 minutes every day,until soon you're coming to workin the middle of the night —the middle of the Earth night.Right? So you can imaginehow confusing that is.Hence, the Mars watch.(Laughter)This weights in this watchhave been mechanically adjustedso that it runs more slowly.Right? And we didn't start out —I got this watch in 2004when Spirit and Opportunity,the rovers back then.We didn't start out thinkingthat we were going to need Mars watches.Right? We thought, OK,we'll just have the time on our computersand on the mission control screens,and that would be enough.Yeah, not so much.Because we weren't justworking on Mars time,we were actually living on Mars time.And we got just instantaneously confusedabout what time it was.So you really needed somethingon your wrist to tell you:What time is it on the Earth?What time is it on Mars?And it wasn't just the time on Marsthat was confusing;we also needed to be ableto talk to each other about it.So a \"sol\" is a Martian day —again, 24 hours and 40 minutes.So when we're talking about somethingthat's happening on the Earth,we will say, today.So, for Mars, we say, \"tosol.\"(Laughter)Yesterday became \"yestersol\" for Mars.Again, we didn't start out thinking,\"Oh, let's invent a language.\"It was just very confusing.I remember somebodywalked up to me and said,\"I would like to do this activityon the vehicle tomorrow, on the rover.\"And I said, \"Tomorrow, tomorrow,or Mars, tomorrow?\"We started this terminology becausewe needed a way to talk to each other.(Laughter)Tomorrow became \"nextersol\" or \"solorrow.\"Because people have different preferencesfor the words they use.Some of you might say \"soda\"and some of you might say \"pop.\"So we have people who say\"nextersol\" or \"solorrow.\"And then something that I noticed aftera few years of working on these missions,was that the people who workon the rovers, we say \"tosol.\"The people who work on thelanded missions that don't rove around,they say \"tosoul.\"So I could actually tell what missionyou worked on from your Martian accent.(Laughter)So we have the watches and the language,and you're detecting a theme here, right?So that we don't get confused.But even the Earth daylightcould confuse us.If you think that right now,you've come to workand it's the middle of the Martian nightand there's light streaming infrom the windowsthat's going to be confusing as well.So you can see fromthis image of the control roomthat all of the blinds are down.So that there's no light to distract us.The blinds went down all over the buildingabout a week before landing,and they didn't go upuntil we went off Mars time.So this also worksfor the house, for at home.I've been on Mars time three times,and my husband is like,OK, we're getting ready for Mars time.And so he'll put foil all over the windowsand dark curtains and shadesbecause it also affects your families.And so here I was living in kind ofthis darkened environment, but so was he.And he'd gotten used to it.But then I would get these plaintiveemails from him when he was at work.Should I come home? Are you awake?What time is it on Mars?And I decided, OK,so he needs a Mars watch.(Laughter)But of course, it's 2016,so there's an app for that.(Laughter)So now instead of the watches,we can also use our phones.But the impact on familieswas just across the board;it wasn't just those of uswho were working on the roversbut our families as well.This is David Oh,one of our flight directors,and he's at the beach in Los Angeleswith his family at 1:00 in the morning.(Laughter)So because we landed in Augustand his kids didn't have to go backto school until September,they actually went on to Mars timewith him for one month.They got up 40 minutes later every day.And they were on dad's work schedule.So they lived on Mars time for a monthand had these great adventures,like going bowlingin the middle of the nightor going to the beach.And one of the thingsthat we all discoveredis you can get anywhere in Los Angelesat 3:00 in the morningwhen there's no traffic. (Laughter) So we would get off work,and we didn't want to go homeand bother our families,and we were hungry, so instead ofgoing locally to eat something,we'd go, \"Wait, there's this greatall-night deli in Long Beach,and we can get there in 10 minutes!\"So we would drive down —it was like the 60s, no traffic.We would drive down there,and the restaurant owners would go,\"Who are you people?And why are you at my restaurantat 3:00 in the morning?\"So they came to realizethat there were these packs of Martians,roaming the LA freeways,in the middle of the night —in the middle of the Earth night.And we did actuallystart calling ourselves Martians.So those of us who were on Mars timewould refer to ourselves as Martians,and everyone else as Earthlings. (Laughter) And that's because when you're movinga time-zone every day,you start to really feel separatedfrom everyone else.You're literally in your own world.So I have this button on that says,\"I survived Mars time. Sol 0-90.\"And there's a picture of itup on the screen.So the reason we got these buttonsis because we work on Mars timein order to be as efficient as possiblewith the rover on Mars,to make the best use of our time.But we don't stay on Mars timefor more than three to four months.Eventually, we'll move to a modified Marstime, which is what we're working now.And that's because it's hard onyour bodies, it's hard on your families.In fact, there were sleep researcherswho actually were studying usbecause it was so unusual for humansto try to extend their day.And they had about 30 of usthat they would dosleep deprivation experiments on.So I would come in and take the testand I fell asleep in each one.And that was because, again,this eventually becomes hard on your body.Even though it was a blast.It was a huge bonding experiencewith the other members on the team,but it is difficult to sustain.So these rover missions are our firststeps out into the solar system.We are learning how to liveon more than one planet.We are changing our perspectiveto become multi-planetary.So the next time you seea Star Wars movie,and there are people goingfrom the Dagobah system to Tatooine,think about what it really means to havepeople spread out so far.What it means in termsof the distances between them,how they will start to feelseparate from each otherand just the logistics of the time.We have not sent peopleto Mars yet, but we hope to.And between companies like SpaceX and NASAand all of the internationalspace agencies of the world,we hope to do thatin the next few decades.So soon we will have people on Mars,and we truly will be multi-planetary.And the young boy or the young girlwho will be going to Mars could bein this audience or listening today.I have wanted to work at JPLon these missions since I was 14 years oldand I am privileged to be a part of it.And this is a remarkable timein the space program,and we are all in this journey together.So the next time you thinkyou don't have enough time in your day,just remember, it's all a matterof your Earthly perspective.Thank you.(Applause) Nagin Cox is a first-generation Martian.

41	"Every summer, my family and Itravel across the world,3,000 miles awayto the culturally diversecountry of India.Now, India is a country infamousfor its scorching heat and humidity.For me, the only relief from this heatis to drink plenty of water.Now, while in India,my parents always remind meto only drink boiled or bottled water,because unlike here in America,where I can just turn on a tapand easily get clean, potable water,in India, the water is often contaminated.So my parents have to make surethat the water we drink is safe. However, I soon realizedthat not everyone is fortunate enoughto enjoy the clean water we did.Outside my grandparents' housein the busy streets of India,I saw people standing in long linesunder the hot sunfilling buckets with water from a tap.I even saw children,who looked the same age as me,filling up these clear plastic bottleswith dirty waterfrom streams on the roadside.Watching these kidsforced to drink waterthat I felt was too dirty to touchchanged my perspective on the world.This unacceptable social injusticecompelled me to want to find a solutionto our world's clean water problem.I wanted to knowwhy these kids lacked water,a substance that is essential for life.And I learned that we are facinga global water crisis. Now, this may seem surprising,as 75 percent of our planetis covered in water,but only 2.5 percentof that is freshwater,and less than one percentof Earth's freshwater supplyis available for human consumption.With rising populations,industrial developmentand economic growth,our demand for clean water is increasing,yet our freshwater resourcesare rapidly depleting.According to theWorld Health Organization,660 million people in our worldlack access to a clean water source.Lack of access to clean wateris a leading cause of deathin children under the age of fivein developing countries,and UNICEF estimates that 3,000 childrendie every day froma water-related disease. So after returning homeone summer in eighth grade,I decided that I wantedto combine my passionfor solving the global water crisiswith my interest in science.So I decided that the best thing to dowould be to convert my garageinto a laboratory. (Laughter) Actually, at first I convertedmy kitchen into a laboratory,but my parents didn't really approveand kicked me out. I also read a lot of journal paperson water-related research,and I learned that currentlyin developing countries,something called solar disinfection,or SODIS, is used to purify water.In SODIS, clear plastic bottlesare filled with contaminated waterand then exposed to sunlightfor six to eight hours.The UV radiation from the sundestroys the DNAof these harmful pathogensand decontaminates the water.Now, while SODIS is really easy to useand energy-efficient,as it only uses solar energy,it's really slow,as it can take up to two dayswhen it's cloudy.So in order to makethe SODIS process faster,this new method called photocatalysishas recently been used. So what exactly is this photocatalysis?Let's break it down:\"photo\" means from the sun,and a catalyst is somethingthat speeds up a reaction.So what photocatalysis is doingis it's just speeding upthis solar disinfection process.When sunlight comes inand strikes a photocatalyst,like TiO2, or titanium dioxide,it creates thesereally reactive oxygen species,like superoxides, hydrogen peroxideand hydroxyl radicals.These reactive oxygen speciesare able to remove bacteria and organicsand a whole lot of contaminantsfrom drinking water. But unfortunately,there are several disadvantagesto the way photocatalytic SODISis currently deployed.See, what they do is they takethe clear plastic bottlesand they coat the insidewith this photocatalytic coating.But photocatalysts like titanium dioxideare actually commonly used in sunscreensto block UV radiation.So when they're coatedon the inside of these bottles,they're actually blockingsome of the UV radiationand diminishing the efficiencyof the process.Also, these photocatalytic coatingsare not tightly boundto the plastic bottle,which means they wash off,and people end up drinking the catalyst.While TiO2 is safe and inert,it's really inefficientif you keep drinking the catalyst,because then you haveto continue to replenish it,even after a few uses. So my goal wasto overcome the disadvantagesof these current treatment methodsand create a safe, sustainable,cost-effective and eco-friendlymethod of purifying water.What started off as an eighth gradescience fair projectis now my photocatalytic compositefor water purification.The composite combinestitanium dioxide with cement.The cement-like composite can be formedinto several different shapes,which results in an extremelyversatile range of deployment methods.For example, you could create a rodthat can easily be placedinside water bottles for individual useor you could create a porous filterthat can filter water for families.You can even coat the insideof an existing water tankto purify larger amounts of waterfor communitiesover a longer period of time. Now, over the course of this,my journey hasn't really been easy.You know, I didn't have accessto a sophisticated laboratory.I was 14 years old when I started,but I didn't let my age deter mein my interestin pursuing scientific researchand wanting to solvethe global water crisis. See, water isn'tjust the universal solvent.Water is a universal human right.And for that reason,I'm continuing to workon this science fair project from 2012to bring it from the laboratoryinto the real world.And this summer,I founded Catalyst for World Water,a social enterprise aimed at catalyzingsolutions to the global water crisis. (Applause) Alone, a single drop of watercan't do much,but when many drops come together,they can sustain life on our planet.Just as water dropscome together to form oceans,I believe that we all must come togetherwhen tackling this global problem. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Deepika Kurup has been determined to solve the global water crisis since she was 14 years old, after she saw kids outside her grandparents' house in India drinking water that looked too dirty even to touch. Her research began in her family kitchen — and eventually led to a major science prize. Hear how this teenage scientist developed a cost-effective, eco-friendly way to purify water. Water is the basis of life, and too many people around the world suffer from waterborne illnesses. Deepika Kurup is working to change that.

42	"I'm a relationship builder.When you think of a relationship builder,don't you just automaticallythink \"architect?\"Probably not.That's because most people thinkarchitects design buildings and cities,but what we really designare relationships,because cities are about people.They're places where people come togetherfor all kinds of exchange.And besides, skylinesare highly specific urban habitatswith their own insects,plants and animals,and even their own weather. But today, urban habitatsare out of balance.Climate change, together with politicaland economic troubles,are having an impact;they're adding upand stressing out cities and us,the people who live in them. For me, the field of ecologyhas provided important insight,because ecologists don't just lookat individual species on their own,they look at the relationshipsbetween living thingsand their environment.They look at how all the diverse partsof the ecosystem are interconnected,and it's actually this balance,this web of life, that sustains life.My team and I have been applyinginsights from ecology to architectureto see how physical spacecan help build stronger relationships.The projects I'm going to show you todayuse the idea of building relationshipsas the key driver for design. Here's an example of what I mean.Recently, we were asked to designa center for social justice leadershipcalled the Arcus Center.They asked us for a buildingthat could break down traditional barriersbetween different groupsand in doing so, create possibilitiesfor meaningful conversationsaround social justice.The students wanted a placefor cultural exchange.They thought a place for preparingfood together could do that.And they wanted to be welcomingto the outside community.They thought a fireplacecould draw people inand help start conversations.And everybody wanted the workof social justice to be visibleto the outside world.There really wasn't a precedentfor this kind of space,so we looked around the globeand found examplesof community meeting houses.Community meeting houses are placeswhere there's very specificrelationships between people,like this one in Mali,where the elders gather.The low roof keeps everybody seatedand at equal eye level.It's very egalitarian.I mean, you can't stand upand take over the meeting.You'd actually bump your head. (Laughter) In meeting houses,there's always a central spacewhere you can sit around a circleand see each other.So we designed a space just like thatright in the middle of the Arcus Center,and we anchored itwith a fireplace and a kitchen.It's pretty hard to get a kitchenand a fireplace in a building like thiswith the building codes,but it was so importantto the concept, we got it done.And now the central spaceworks for big social gatheringsand a place to meet one-on-onefor the very first time.It's almost likethis three-way intersectionthat encourages bumping into peopleand starting a conversation.Now you can always pass the kitchenand see something going on.You can sit by the fireplaceand share stories.You can study togetherin big groups or in small ones,because the architecturesets up these opportunities. Even the constructionis about building relationships.It's made of cordwood masonry,which is using logsthe way you would use bricks.It's super low-tech and easy to doand anyone can do it —and that's the entire point.The act of making is a social activity. And it's good for the planet, too:the trees absorbed carbonwhen they were growing up,and they gave off oxygen,and now that carbonis trapped inside the wallsand it's not being releasedinto the atmosphere.So making the walls is equivalentto taking cars right off the road.We chose the building methodbecause it connects peopleto each other and to the environment. But is it working?Is it creating relationshipsand nurturing them?How can we know?Well, more and more peopleare coming here, for one,and as a result of the fireside chatsand a full calendar of programming,people are applyingfor the Arcus Fellowships.In fact, applications have increasedtenfold for the Arcus Fellowshipsince the building opened.It's working. It's bringingpeople together. So I've shown how architecturecan connect peopleon this kind of horizontal campus scale.But we wondered if social relationshipscould be scaled up —or rather, upward — in tall buildings.Tall buildings don't necessarily lendthemselves to being social buildings.They can seem isolating and inward.You might only see peoplein those awkward elevator rides.But in several major cities,I've been designing tall buildingsthat are based on creatingrelationships between people. This is Aqua.It's a residential high-rise in Chicagoaimed at young urban professionalsand empty nesters,many of them new to the city.With over 700 apartments, we wanted to seeif we could use architectureto help people get to knowtheir neighbors,even when their homes are organizedin the vertical dimension.So we invented a way to use balconiesas the new social connectors.The shapes of the floor slabsvary slightly and they transitionas you go up the tower.The result of thisis that you can actually see peoplefrom your balcony.The balconies are misregistered.You can lean over your balconyand say, \"Hey!\"just like you would across the backyard.To make the balconies more comfortablefor a longer period of timeduring the year,we studied the windwith digital simulations,so the effect of the balcony shapesbreaks up the windand confuses the windand makes the balconiesmore comfortable and less windy. Now, just by being ableto go outside on your balconyor on the third floor roof terrace,you can be connected to the outdoors,even when you're way abovethe ground plane.So the building acts to create communitywithin the building and the cityat the same time.It's working.And people are starting to meet each otheron the building surfaceand we've heard —n(Laughter) they've even starting gettingtogether as couples.But besides romantic relationships,the building has a positive social effecton the community,as evidenced by peoplestarting groups togetherand starting big projects together,like this organic community gardenon the building's roof terrace. So I've shown how tall buildingscan be social connectors,but what about public architecture?How can we create bettersocial cohesion in public buildingsand civic spaces,and why is it important?Public architectureis just not as successfulif it comes from the top down. About 15 years ago in Chicago,they started to replaceold police stations,and they built this identical modelall over the city.And even though they had good intentionsof treating all neighborhoods equally,the communities didn't feelinvested in the processor feel a sense of ownershipof these buildings.It was equality in the sense thateverybody gets the same police station,but it wasn't equityin the sense of respondingto each community's individual needs.And equity is the key issue here. You know, in my field, there's a debateabout whether architecturecan even do anythingto improve social relationships.But I believe that we need architectureand every tool in our tool kitto improve these relationships.In the US, policy reformshave been recommendedin order to rebuild trust.But my team and I wonderedif design and a more inclusivedesign processcould help add something positiveto this policy conversation.We asked ourselves simply:Can design help rebuild trust? So we reached out to community membersand police officers in North Lawndale;it's a neighborhood in Chicagowhere the police stationis perceived as a scary fortresssurrounded by a parking lot.In North Lawndale,people are afraid of policeand of going anywherenear the police station,even to report a crime.So we organized this brainstorming sessionwith both groups participating,and we came up with this wholenew idea for the police station.It's called \"Polis Station.\"\"Polis\" is a Greek word that meansa place with a sense of community.It's based on the ideathat if you can increase opportunitiesfor positive social interactionsbetween police and community members,you can rebuild that relationshipand activate the neighborhoodat the same time. Instead of the police stationas a scary fortress,you get highly active spaceson the public side of the station —places that spark conversation,like a barbershop, a coffee shopor sports courts as well.Both cops and kids said they love sports.These insights came directlyfrom the community membersand the police officers themselves,and as designers, our rolewas just to connect the dotsand suggest the first step.So with the helpof the city and the parks,we were able to raise fundsand design and build a half-court,right on the police station parking lot. It's a start.But is it rebuilding trust?The people in North Lawndale saythe kids are using the courts every dayand they even organize tournamentslike this one shown here,and once in a while an officer joins in.But now, they even have basketballsinside the stationthat kids can borrow.And recently they've asked usto expand the courtsand build a park on the site.And parents report something astonishing.Before, there was fear of goinganywhere the station, and now they saythere's a sense that the court is saferthan other courts nearby,and they prefer their kids to play here. So maybe in the future,on the public side of the station,you might be able to drop infor a haircut at the barbershopor reserve the community roomfor a birthday partyor renew your driver's licenseor get money out of an ATM.It can be a place for neighborsto meet each otherand to get to knowthe officers, and vice versa.This is not a utopian fantasy.It's about how do you designto rebuild trust,trusting relationships? You know, every city has parks,libraries, schoolsand other public buildingsthat have the potentialto be reimagined as social connectors.But reimagining the buildingsfor the future is going to requireengaging the people who live there.Engaging the public can be intimidating,and I've felt that, too.But maybe that's becausein architecture school,we don't really learn how to engagethe public in the act of design.We're taught to defendour design against criticism.But I think that can change, too. So if we can focus the design mindon creating positive,reinforcing relationshipsin architecture and through architecture,I believe we can do much morethan create individual buildings.We can reduce the stressand the polarizationin our urban habitats.We can create relationships.We can help steadythis planet we all share. See?Architects really arerelationship builders. (Laughter) Thank you very much. (Applause) A skyscraper that channels the breeze ... a building that creates community around a hearth ...

43	"So what if I could make for youa designer baby?What if you as a parent-to-beand I as a scientist decidedto go down that road together? What if we didn't?What if we thought, \"That's a bad idea,\"but many of our family,friends and coworkersdid make that decision? Let's fast-forward just 15 years from now.Let's pretend it's the year 2030,and you're a parent.You have your daughter,Marianne, next to you,and in 2030, she is what we call a naturalbecause she has no genetic modifications.And because you and your partnerconsciously made that decision,many in your social circle,they kind of look down on you.They think you're, like,a Luddite or a technophobe. Marianne's best friend Jenna,who lives right next door,is a very different story.She was born a genetically modifieddesigner baby with numerous upgrades.Yeah. Upgrades.And these enhancements were introducedusing a new geneticmodification technologythat goes by the funny name CRISPR,you know, like something's crisp,this is CRISPR.The scientist that Jenna's parentshired to do thisfor several million dollarsintroduced CRISPRinto a whole panel of human embryos.And then they used genetic testing,and they predicted thatthat little tiny embryo, Jenna's embryo,would be the best of the bunch.And now, Jenna is an actual, real person.She's sitting on the carpetin your living roomplaying with your daughter Marianne.And your families have knowneach other for years now,and it's become very clear to youthat Jenna is extraordinary.She's incredibly intelligent.If you're honest with yourself,she's smarter than you,and she's five years old.She's beautiful, tall, athletic,and the list goes on and on.And in fact, there'sa whole new generationof these GM kids like Jenna.And so far it looks likethey're healthierthan their parents' generation,than your generation.And they have lower health care costs.They're immune to a hostof health conditions,including HIV/AIDS and genetic diseases. It all sounds so great,but you can't help but havethis sort of unsettling feeling,a gut feeling, that there's somethingjust not quite right about Jenna,and you've had the same feelingabout other GM kids that you've met.You were also readingin the newspaper earlier this weekthat a study of these childrenwho were born as designer babiesindicates they may have some issues,like increased aggressivenessand narcissism.But more immediately on your mindis some news that you just gotfrom Jenna's family.She's so smart,she's now going to be goingto a special school,a different schoolthan your daughter Marianne,and this is kind of throwingyour family into a disarray.Marianne's been crying,and last night when you took her to bedto kiss her goodnight,she said, \"Daddy, will Jennaeven be my friend anymore?\"nSo now, as I've been telling youthis imagined 2030 story,I have a feelingthat I may have put some of youinto this sci-fiframe of reference. Right?You think you're reading a sci-fi book.Or maybe, like,in Halloween mode of thinking.But this is reallya possible reality for us,just 15 years from now. I'm a stem cell and genetics researcherand I can see this new CRISPR technologyand its potential impact.And we may find ourselves in that reality,and a lot will dependon what we decide to do today.And if you're stillkind of thinking in sci-fi mode,consider that the world of sciencehad a huge shock earlier this year,and the public largelydoesn't even know about it.Researchers in China just a few months agoreported the creationof genetically modified human embryos.This was the first time in history.And they did it usingthis new CRISPR technology.It didn't work perfectly,but I still thinkthey sort of cracked the door ajaron a Pandora's box here.And I think some peopleare going to run with this technologyand try to make designer babies. Now, before I go on, some of youmay hold up your hands and say,\"Stop, Paul, wait a minute.Wouldn't that be illegal?You can't just go offand create a designer baby.\"And in fact, to some extent, you're right.In some countries, you couldn't do that.But in many other countries,including my country, the US,there's actually no law on this,so in theory, you could do it.And there was another developmentthis year that resonates in this area,and that happenednot so far from here over in the UK.And the UK traditionallyhas been the strictest countrywhen it comes to humangenetic modification.It was illegal there,but just a few months ago,they carved out an exception to that rule.They passed a new lawallowing the creationof genetically modified humanswith the noble goal of tryingto prevent a rare kind of genetic disease.But still I think in combinationthese events are pushing usfurther towards an acceptanceof human genetic modification. So I've been talkingabout this CRISPR technology.What actually is CRISPR?So if you think about the GMOsthat we're all more familiar with,like GMO tomatoes and wheatand things like that,this technologyis similar to the technologiesthat were used to make those,but it's dramatically better,cheaper and faster. So what is it?It's actually likea genetic Swiss army knife.We can pretend this is a Swiss army knifewith different tools in it,and one of the toolsis kind of like a magnifying glassor a GPS for our DNA,so it can home in on a certain spot.And the next tool is like scissorsthat can cut the DNA right in that spot.And finally we have a penwhere we can literally rewritethe genetic code in that location.It's really that simple. And this technology, which cameon the scene just three years ago,has taken science by storm.It's evolving so fast, and it'sso freaking exciting to scientists,and I admit I'm fascinated by itand we use it in my own lab,that I think someoneis going to go that extra stepand continue the GM human embryo workand maybe make designer babies.This is so ubiquitous now.It just came on the scene three years ago.Thousands of labsliterally have this in hand today,and they're doing important research.Most of them are not interestedin designer babies.They're studying human diseaseand other important elements of science.So there's a lot of good researchgoing on with CRISPR.And the fact that we cannow do genetic modificationsthat used to take yearsand cost millions of dollarsin a few weeksfor a couple thousand bucks,to me as a scientist that's fantastic,but again, at the same time,it opens the door to people going too far.And I think for some peoplethe focus is not going to beso much on science.That's not what's goingto be driving them.It's going to be ideologyor the chase for a profit.And they're going to gofor designer babies. So why should we be concerned about this?We know from Darwin,if we go back two centuries,that evolution and geneticsprofoundly have impacted humanity,who we are today.And some think there's likea social Darwinism at work in our world,and maybe even a eugenics as well.Imagine those trends, those forces,with a booster rocketof this CRISPR technologythat is so powerful and so ubiquitous.And in fact, we can just go backone century to the last centuryto see the power that eugenics can have. So my father, Peter Knoepfler,was actually born right here in Vienna.He was Viennese,and he was born here in 1929.And when my grandparentshad little baby Peter,the world was very different. Right?It was a different Vienna.The United States was different.The world was different.There was a eugenics rising,and my grandparents realized,pretty quickly I think,that they were on the wrong sideof the eugenics equation.And so despite this being their homeand their whole extended family's home,and this area being their family'shome for generations,they decided because of eugenicsthat they had to leave.And they survived,but they were heartbroken,and I'm not sure my dadever really got over leaving Vienna.He left when he was just eight years oldin 1938. So today, I see a new eugenicskind of bubbling to the surface.It's supposed to be a kinder,gentler, positive eugenics,different than all that past stuff.But I think even though it's focusedon trying to improve people,it could have negative consequences,and it really worries methat some of the top proponentsof this new eugenics,they think CRISPR is the ticketto make it happen. So I have to admit, you know,eugenics, we talkabout making better people.It's a tough question.What is better when we're talkingabout a human being?But I admit I think maybe a lot of uscould agree that human beings,maybe we could use a little betterment.Look at our politicianshere, you know, back in the US —God forbid we go there right now.Maybe even if we just look in the mirror,there might be wayswe think we could be better.I might wish, honestly, that I hadmore hair here, instead of baldness.Some people might wish they were taller,have a different weight, a different face.If we could do those things,we could make those things happen,or we could make them happenin our children,it would be very seductive.And yet coming with itwould be these risks.I talked about eugenics,but there would be risksto individuals as well.So if we forget about enhancing peopleand we just try to make themhealthier using genetic modification,this technology is so newand so powerful,that by accidentwe could make them sicker.That easily could happen.And there's another risk,and that is that all of the legitimate,important genetic modification researchgoing on just in the lab —again, no interest in designer babies —a few people goingthe designer baby route,things go badly,that entire field could be damaged. I also think it's not that unlikelythat governments might start takingan interest in genetic modification.So for example our imagined GM Jenna childwho is healthier,if there's a generation that lookslike they have lower health care costs,it's possible that governmentsmay start trying to compel their citizensto go the GM route.Look at China's one-child policy.It's thought that that preventedthe birth of 400 million human beings.So it's not beyond the realm of possiblethat genetic modificationcould be something that governments push.And if designer babies become popular,in our digital age —viral videos, social media —what if designer babiesare thought to be fashionable,and they kind of becomethe new glitterati,the new Kardashians or something? (Laughter) You know, are those trendsthat we really could control?I'm not convinced that we could. So again, today it's Halloweenand when we talkabout genetic modification,there's one Halloween-associated characterthat is talked aboutor invoked more than anything else,and that is Frankenstein.Mostly that's been Frankenfoodsand all this other stuff.But if we think about this nowand we think about it in the human contexton a day like Halloween,if parents can in essencecostume their children genetically,are we going to be talking abouta Frankenstein 2.0 kind of situation?I don't think so. I don't thinkit's going to get to that extreme.But when we are going abouthacking the human code,I think all bets are offin terms of what might come of that.There would still be dangers.And we can look in the pastto other elementsof transformative scienceand see how they canbasically go out of controland permeate society. So I'll just give you one example,and that is in vitro fertilization.Almost exactly 40 years ago,test tube baby number oneLouise Brown was born,and that's a great thing,and I think since thenfive million IVF babies have been born,bringing immeasurable happiness.A lot of parents now can love those kids.But if you think about it,in four decades,five million babies being bornfrom a new technologyis pretty remarkable,and the same kind of thing could happenwith human genetic modificationand designer babies.So depending on the decisionswe make in the next few months,the next year or so,if designer baby number one is born,within a few decades,there could well be millionsof genetically modified humans.And there's a difference there too,because if we, you in the audience, or I,if we decide to have a designer baby,then their children will alsobe genetically modified, and so on,because it's heritable.So that's a big difference. So with all of this in mind,what should we do?There's actually going to be a meetinga month from tomorrow in Washington, D.C.by the US National Academy of Sciencesto tackle that exact question.What is the right path forwardwith human genetic modification?I believe at this timewe need a moratorium.We have to ban this.We should not allowcreating genetically modified people,because it's just too dangerousand too unpredictable.But there's a lot of people —n(Applause) Thanks. (Applause) And let me say, just as a scientist,it's a little bit scaryfor me to say that in public,because science generally doesn't likeself-regulation and things like that.So I think we need to put a hold on this,but there are many peoplewho not only disagree with me,they feel the exact opposite.They're like, step on the gas,full speed ahead,let's make designer babies.And so in the meeting in Decemberand other meetings that are likelyto follow in the next few months,it's very possiblethere may be no moratorium.And I think partof the problem that we haveis that all of this trend,this revolution in genetic modificationapplying to humans,the public hasn't known about it.Nobody has been saying,look, this is a big deal,this is a revolution,and this could affect youin very personal ways.And so part of my goalis actually to change thatand to educate and engage with the publicand get you guys talking about this.And so I hope at these meetingsthat there will be a role for the publicto bring their voice to bear as well. So if we kind of circle back nowto 2030 again, that imagined story,and depending on the decisionswe make, again, today —literally we don't have a lot of time —in the next few months,the next year or so,because this technologyis spreading like wildfire.Let's pretend we're back in that reality.We're at a park,and our kid is swinging on the swing.Is that kid a regular old kid,or did we decide to have a designer baby?And let's say we wentthe sort of traditional route,and there's our kid swinging on the swing,and frankly, they're kind of a mess.Their hair is all overthe place like mine.They have a stuffy nose.They're not the best student in the world.They're adorable, you love them,but there on the swing next to them,their best friend is a GM kid,and the two of themare kind of swinging like this,and you can't helpbut compare them, right?And the GM kid is swinging higher,they look better,they're a better student,they don't have that stuffy noseyou need to wipe.How is that going to make you feeland what decisionmight you make next time? Thank you. (Applause) Creating genetically modified people is no longer a science fiction fantasy; it's a likely future scenario. Biologist Paul Knoepfler estimates that within fifteen years, scientists could use the gene editing technology CRISPR to make certain \"upgrades\" to human embryos — from altering physical appearances to eliminating the risk of auto-immune diseases. In this thought-provoking talk, Knoepfler readies us for the coming designer baby revolution and its very personal, and unforeseeable, consequences.

44	"For the past few years,I've been spending my summersin the marine biological laboratoryin Woods Hole, Massachusetts.And there, what I've been doingis essentially renting a boat.What I would like to do is ask youto come on a boat ride with me tonight. So, we ride off from Eel Pondinto Vineyard Sound,right off the coast of Martha's Vineyard,equipped with a droneto identify potential spotsfrom which to peer into the Atlantic.Earlier, I was going to sayinto the depths of the Atlantic,but we don't have to go too deepto reach the unknown.Here, barely two miles awayfrom what is arguably the greatestmarine biology lab in the world,we lower a simpleplankton net into the waterand bring up to the surfacethings that humanity rarelypays any attention to,and oftentimes has never seen before. Here's one of the organismsthat we caught in our net.This is a jellyfish.But look closely,and living inside of this animalis another organismthat is very likelyentirely new to science.A complete new species.Or how about this other transparent beautywith a beating heart,asexually growing on top of its head,progeny that will move onto reproduce sexually.Let me say that again:this animal is growing asexuallyon top of its head,progeny that is going to reproducesexually in the next generation.A weird jellyfish?Not quite.This is an ascidian.This is a group of animalsthat now we know we shareextensive genomic ancestry with,and it is perhaps the closestinvertebrate species to our own.Meet your cousin,Thalia democratica. (Laughter) I'm pretty sure you didn't save a spotat your last family reunionfor Thalia,but let me tell you,these animals are profoundly related to usin ways that we're justbeginning to understand.So, next time you hear anybodyderisively telling youthat this type of researchis a simple fishing expedition,I hope that you'll rememberthe trip that we just took. Today, many of the biologicalsciences only see valuein studying deeper what we already know —in mapping already-discovered continents.But some of us are much moreinterested in the unknown.We want to discovercompletely new continents,and gaze at magnificentvistas of ignorance.We crave the experienceof being completely baffledby something we've never seen before.And yes, I agreethere's a lot of little ego satisfactionin being able to say,\"Hey, I was the first oneto discover that.\"But this is nota self-aggrandizing enterprise,because in this typeof discovery research,if you don't feel like a completeidiot most of the time,you're just not sciencing hard enough. (Laughter) So every summer I bring onto the deckof this little boat of oursmore and more thingsthat we know very little about.I would like tonightto tell you a story about lifethat rarely gets toldin an environment like this.From the vantage point of our 21st-centurybiological laboratories,we have begun to illuminatemany mysteries of life with knowledge.We sense that after centuriesof scientific research,we're beginning to makesignificant inroadsinto understanding some of the mostfundamental principles of life. Our collective optimism is reflectedby the growth of biotechnologyacross the globe,striving to utilize scientific knowledgeto cure human diseases.Things like cancer, aging,degenerative diseases;these are but someof the undesirables we wish to tame.I often wonder:Why is it that we are havingso much troubletrying to solve the problem of cancer?Is it that we're trying to solvethe problem of cancer,and not trying to understand life? Life on this planetshares a common origin,and I can summarize 3.5 billion yearsof the history of life on this planetin a single slide.What you see here are representativesof all known species in our planet.In this immensity of lifeand biodiversity,we occupy a rather unremarkable position. (Laughter) Homo sapiens.The last of our kind.And though I don't really wantto disparage at allthe accomplishments of our species,as much as we wish it to be soand often pretend that it is,we are not the measure of all things.We are, however, the measurersof many things.We relentlessly quantify,analyze and compare,and some of this is absolutely invaluableand indeed necessary. But this emphasis today on forcingbiological research to specializeand to produce practical outcomesis actually restricting our abilityto interrogate lifeto unacceptably narrow confinesand unsatisfying depths.We are measuring an astonishinglynarrow sliver of life,and hoping that those numberswill save all of our lives.How narrow do you ask?Well, let me give you a number.The National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration recently estimatedthat about 95 percent of our oceansremain unexplored.Now let that sink in for a second.95 percent of our oceansremain unexplored.I think it's very safe to saythat we don't even knowhow much about life we do not know. So, it's not surprisingthat every week in my fieldwe begin to see the additionof more and more new speciesto this amazing tree of life.This one for example —discovered earlier this summer,new to science,and now occupying its lonely branchin our family tree.What is even more tragicis that we know about a bunchof other species of animals out there,but their biology remainssorely under-studied. I'm sure some of youhave heard about the factthat a starfish can actuallyregenerate its arm after it's lost.But some of you might not knowthat the arm itself can actuallyregenerate a complete starfish.And there are animals out therethat do truly astounding things.I'm almost willing to betthat many of you have never heardof the flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea.This little guy right heredoes things that essentiallyjust blow my mind.You can grab one of these animalsand cut it into 18 different fragments,and each and every one of those fragmentswill go on to regeneratea complete animalin under two weeks.18 heads, 18 bodies, 18 mysteries.For the past decade and a half or so,I've been trying to figure outhow these little dudes do what they do,and how they pull this magic trick off.But like all good magicians,they're not really releasingtheir secrets readily to me. (Laughter) So here we are,after 20 years of essentiallystudying these animals,genome mapping, chin scratching,and thousands of amputationsand thousands of regenerations,we still don't fully understandhow these animals do what they do.Each planarian an ocean unto itself,full of unknowns. One of the common characteristicsof all of these animalsI've been talking to you aboutis that they did not appearto have received the memothat they need to behaveaccording to the rulesthat we have derived from a handfulof randomly selected animalsthat currently populate the vast majorityof biomedical laboratoriesacross the world.Meet our Nobel Prize winners.Seven species, essentially,that have produced for us the bruntof our understandingof biological behavior today.This little guy right here —three Nobel Prizes in 12 years.And yet, after all the attentionthey have garnered,and all the knowledge they have generated,as well as the lion's shareof the funding,here we are standing [before] the samelitany of intractable problemsand many new challenges.And that's because, unfortunately,these seven animals essentially correspondto 0.0009 percent of all of the speciesthat inhabit the planet. So I'm beginning to suspectthat our specialization is beginningto impede our progress at best,and at worst, is leading us astray.That's because lifeon this planet and its historyis the history of rule breakers.Life started on the face of this planetas single-cell organisms,swimming for millionsof years in the ocean,until one of those creatures decided,\"I'm going to do things differently today;today I would like to inventsomething called multicellularity,and I'm going to do this.\"And I'm sure it wasn't a populardecision at the time —n(Laughter) but somehow, it managed to do it.And then, multicellularorganisms began to populateall these ancestral oceans,and they thrived.And we have them here today.Land masses began to emergefrom the surface of the oceans,and another creature thought,\"Hey, that looks like a really nicepiece of real estate.I'd like to move there.\"\"Are you crazy?You're going to desiccate out there.Nothing can live out of water.\"But life found a way,and there are organismsnow that live on land.Once on land, they may havelooked up into the skyand said, \"It would be niceto go to the clouds,I'm going to fly.\"\"You can't break the law of gravity,there's no way you can fly.\"And yet, nature has invented —multiple and independent times —ways to fly. I love to study these animalsthat break the rules,because every time they break a rule,they invent something newthat made it possible for usto be able to be here today.These animals did not get the memo.They break the rules.So if we're going to study animalsthat break the rules,shouldn't how we study themalso break the rules? I think we need to renewour spirit of exploration.Rather than bring natureinto our laboratoriesand interrogate it there,we need to bring our scienceinto the majestic laboratorythat is nature,and there, with our moderntechnological armamentarium,interrogate every new formof life we find,and any new biological attributethat we may find.We actually need to bringall of our intelligenceto becoming stupid again —clueless [before] the immensityof the unknown.Because after all,science is not really about knowledge.Science is about ignorance.That's what we do. Once, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote,\"If you want to build a ship,don't drum up people to collect woodand don't assign them tasks and work,but rather teach them to longfor the endless immensity of the sea ...\"As a scientist and a teacher,I like to paraphrase this to readthat we scientists needto teach our studentsto long for the endlessimmensity of the seathat is our ignorance.We Homo sapiens are the onlyspecies we know ofthat is driven to scientific inquiry.We, like all other species on this planet,are inextricably woveninto the history of life on this planet.And I think I'm a little wrongwhen I say that life is a mystery,because I think that lifeis actually an open secretthat has been beckoning our speciesfor millennia to understand it. So I ask you:Aren't we the best chancethat life has to know itself?And if so,what the heck are we waiting for? Thank you. (Applause) Nature is wonderfully abundant, diverse and mysterious — but biological research today tends to focus on only seven species, including rats, chickens, fruit flies and us. We're studying an astonishingly narrow sliver of life, says biologist Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado, and hoping it'll be enough to solve the oldest, most challenging problems in science, like cancer. In this visually captivating talk, Alvarado calls on us to interrogate the unknown and shows us the remarkable discoveries that surface when we do. Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado wants to understand the how and why of tissue regeneration. Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado wants to understand the how and why of tissue regeneration."
45	"How many of you have usedan electronic spreadsheet,like Microsoft Excel?Very good.Now, how many of you have run a businesswith a spreadsheet by hand,like my dad did for his smallprinting business in Philadelphia?A lot less. Well, that's the way it was donefor hundreds of years.In early 1978,I started working on an ideathat eventually became VisiCalc.And the next year it shippedrunning on something newcalled an Apple II personal computer.You could tell that thingshad really changed when, six years later,the Wall Street Journal ran an editorialthat assumed you knew what VisiCalc wasand maybe even were using it. Steve Jobs back in 1990said that \"spreadsheetspropelled the industry forward.\"\"VisiCalc propelled the success of Applemore than any other single event.\"On a more personal note,Steve said, \"If VisiCalc had been writtenfor some other computer,you'd be interviewingsomebody else right now.\"nSo, VisiCalc was instrumental in gettingpersonal computers on business desks.How did it come about?What was it? What did I go throughto make it be what it was?Well, I first learned to programback in 1966, when I was 15 —just a couple monthsafter this photo was taken.Few high schoolers had accessto computers in those days.But through luckand an awful lot of perseverance,I was able to getcomputer time around the city. After sleeping in the mud at Woodstock,I went off to MIT to go to college,where to make money,I worked on the Multics Project.Multics was a trailblazinginteractive time-sharing system.Have you heard of the Linuxand Unix operating systems?They came from Multics.I worked on the Multics versionsof what are knownas interpreted computer languages,that are used by peoplein noncomputer fieldsto do their calculationswhile seated at a computer terminal. After I graduated from MIT,I went to work forDigital Equipment Corporation.At DEC, I worked on softwarefor the new areaof computerized typesetting.I helped newspapersreplace their reporters' typewriterswith computer terminals.I'd write softwareand then I'd go out in the fieldto places like the Kansas City Star,where I would train usersand get feedback.This was real-world experiencethat is quite differentthan what I saw in the lab at MIT. After that, I was project leaderof the software for DEC's firstword processor, again a new field.Like with typesetting, the important thingwas crafting a user interfacethat was both natural and efficientfor noncomputer people to use.After I was at DEC, I wentto work for a small companythat made microprocessor-based electroniccash registers for the fast-food industry.But I had always wanted to starta company with my friend Bob Frankstonthat I met on the Multics project at MIT. So I decided to go back to school to learnas much as I could about business.And in the fall of 1977,I entered the MBA programat Harvard Business School.I was one of the fewpercentage of studentswho had a backgroundin computer programming.There's a picture of me from the yearbooksitting in the front row. (Laughter) Now, at Harvard,we learned by the case method.We'd do about three cases a day.Cases consist of up to a few dozen pagesdescribing particular business situations.They often have exhibits,and exhibits often have words and numberslaid out in ways that make sensefor the particular situation.They're usually all somewhat different.Here's my homework.Again, numbers, words,laid out in ways that made sense.Lots of calculations —we got really close to our calculators.In fact, here's my calculator.For Halloween, I wentdressed up as a calculator. (Laughter) At the beginning of each class,the professor would call on somebodyto present the case.What they would do isthey would explain what was going onand then dictate informationthat the professor would transcribeonto the many motorized blackboardsin the front of the class,and then we'd have a discussion.One of the really frustrating thingsis when you've done all your homework,you come in the next dayonly to find out that you made an errorand all of the other numbersyou did were wrong.And you couldn't participate as well.And we were marked by class participation. So, sitting there with 87 other peoplein the class, I got to daydream a lot.Most programmers in those daysworked on mainframes,building things like inventory systems,payroll systems and bill-paying systems.But I had workedon interactive word processingand on-demand personal computation.Instead of thinkingabout paper printouts and punch cards,I imagined a magic blackboardthat if you erased one numberand wrote a new thing in,all of the other numberswould automatically change,like word processing with numbers.I imagined that my calculatorhad mouse hardware on the bottom of itand a head-up display,like in a fighter plane.And I could type some numbers in,and circle it, and press the sum button.And right in the middle of a negotiationI'd be able to get the answer.Now I just had to take my fantasyand turn it into reality. My father taught me about prototyping.He showed me mock-upsthat he'd make to figure outthe placement on the pagefor the things for brochuresthat he was printing.And he'd use itto get feedback from customersand OKs before he sent the joboff to the presses.The act of making a simple, workingversion of what you're trying to buildforces you to uncover key problems.And it lets you find solutionsto those problems much less expensively. So I decided to build a prototype.I went to a video terminal connected toHarvard's time-sharing systemand got to work.One of the first problemsthat I ran into was:How do you represent values in formulas?Let me show you what I mean.I thought that you would point somewhere,type in some words,then type in some somewhere else,put in some numbers and some more numbers,point where you want the answer.And then point to the first, press minus,point to the second,and get the result.The problem was:What should I put in the formula?It had to be somethingthe computer knew what to put in.And if you looked at the formula,you needed to knowwhere on the screen it referred to.The first thing I thought wasthe programmer way of doing it.The first time you pointed to somewhere,the computer would ask youto type in a unique name.It became pretty clear pretty fast thatthat was going to be too tedious.The computer had to automaticallymake up the name and put it inside.So I thought, why not make it bethe order in which you create them?I tried that. Value 1, value 2.Pretty quickly I sawthat if you had more than a few valuesyou'd never rememberon the screen where things were. Then I said, why not instead ofallowing you to put values anywhere,I'll restrict you to a grid?Then when you pointed to a cell,the computer could putthe row and column in as a name.And, if I did it like a map and put ABCacross the top and numbers along the side,if you saw B7 in a formula,you'd know exactlywhere it was on the screen.And if you had to type the formulain yourself, you'd know what to do.Restricting you to a gridhelped solve my problem.It also opened up new capabilities,like the ability to have ranges of cells.But it wasn't too restrictive —you could still put any value,any formula, in any cell.And that's the way we do it to this day,almost 40 years later. My friend Bob and I decided that we weregoing to build this product together.I did more work figuring out exactlyhow the program was supposed to behave.I wrote a reference cardto act as documentation.It also helped me ensurethat the user interface I was definingcould be explained conciselyand clearly to regular people.Bob worked in the attic of the apartmenthe rented in Arlington, Massachusetts.This is the inside of the attic.Bob bought time on the MIT Multics Systemto write computer codeon a terminal like this.And then he would download test versionsto a borrowed Apple IIover a phone lineusing an acoustic coupler,and then we would test. For one of these tests I preparedfor this case about the Pepsi Challenge.Print wasn't working yet,so I had to copy everything down.Save wasn't working,so every time it crashed,I had to type in all of the formulasagain, over and over again.The next day in class, I raised my hand;I got called on, and I presented the case.I did five-year projections.I did all sorts of different scenarios.I aced the case.VisiCalc was already useful. The professor said, \"How did you do it?\"Well, I didn't want to tell himabout our secret program. (Laughter) So I said, \"I took this and added thisand multiplied by thisand subtracted that.\"nHe said, \"Well,why didn't you use a ratio?\"nI said, \"Hah! A ratio —that wouldn't have been as exact!\"What I didn't say was,\"Divide isn't working yet.\"n(Laughter) Eventually, though,we did finish enough of VisiCalcto be able to show it to the public.My dad printed up a sample reference cardthat we could use as marketing material. In June of 1979, our publisherannounced VisiCalc to the world,in a small booth at the giant NationalComputer Conference in New York City.The New York Times hada humorous article about the conference.\"The machines performwhat seem religious rites ...Even as the believers gather,the painters in the Coliseum sign roomare adding to the pantheon,carefully lettering 'VISICALC'in giant black on yellow.All hail VISICALC!\"(Gasp) New York Times:\"All hail VISICALC.\"n(Laughter) That was the last mentionof the electronic spreadsheetin the popular business pressfor about two years.Most people didn't get it yet.But some did. In October of 1979, we shipped VisiCalc.It came in packagingthat looked like this.And it looked like thisrunning on the Apple II.And the rest, as they say, is history. Now, there's an awful lotmore to this story,but that'll have to wait for another day.One thing, though, Harvard remembers.Here's that classroom.They put up a plaqueto commemorate what happened there. (Applause) But it also serves as a reminderthat you, too, should takeyour unique backgrounds, skills and needsand build prototypes to discoverand work out the key problems,and through that, change the world. Thank you. (Applause) Dan Bricklin changed the world forever when he codeveloped VisiCalc, the first electronic spreadsheet and grandfather of programs you probably use every day like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.

46	"Let's imagine a sculptorbuilding a statue,just chipping away with his chisel.Michelangelo had this elegant wayof describing it when he said,\"Every block of stonehas a statue inside of it,and it's the taskof the sculptor to discover it.\"But what if he workedin the opposite direction?Not from a solid block of stone,but from a pile of dust,somehow gluing millions of these particlestogether to form a statue. I know that's an absurd notion.It's probably impossible.The only way you geta statue from a pile of dustis if the statue built itself —if somehow we could compel millionsof these particles to come togetherto form the statue. Now, as odd as that sounds,that is almost exactly the problemI work on in my lab.I don't build with stone,I build with nanomaterials.They're these just impossibly small,fascinating little objects.They're so small that if this controllerwas a nanoparticle,a human hair would be the sizeof this entire room.And they're at the heart of a fieldwe call nanotechnology,which I'm sure we've all heard about,and we've all heardhow it is going to change everything. When I was a graduate student,it was one of the most exciting timesto be working in nanotechnology.There were scientific breakthroughshappening all the time.The conferences were buzzing,there was tons of moneypouring in from funding agencies.And the reason iswhen objects get really small,they're governed by a different setof physics that govern ordinary objects,like the ones we interact with.We call this physics quantum mechanics.And what it tells you isthat you can precisely tune their behaviorjust by making seeminglysmall changes to them,like adding or removinga handful of atoms,or twisting the material.It's like this ultimate toolkit.You really felt empowered;you felt like you could make anything. And we were doing it —and by we I mean my wholegeneration of graduate students.We were trying to make blazing fastcomputers using nanomaterials.We were constructing quantum dotsthat could one day go in your bodyand find and fight disease.There were even groupstrying to make an elevator to spaceusing carbon nanotubes.You can look that up, that's true.Anyways, we thought it was going to affectall parts of science and technology,from computing to medicine.And I have to admit,I drank all of the Kool-Aid.I mean, every last drop. But that was 15 years ago,and —fantastic science was done,really important work.We've learned a lot.We were never able to translatethat science into new technologies —into technologiesthat could actually impact people.And the reason is, these nanomaterials —they're like a double-edged sword.The same thing that makesthem so interesting —their small size —also makes them impossible to work with.It's literally like trying to builda statue out of a pile of dust.And we just don't have the toolsthat are small enough to work with them.But even if we did,it wouldn't really matter,because we couldn't one by oneplace millions of particles togetherto build a technology.So because of that,all of the promiseand all of the excitementhas remained just that:promise and excitement.We don't have anydisease-fighting nanobots,there's no elevators to space,and the thing that I'm most interested in,no new types of computing. Now that last one,that's a really important one.We just have come to expectthe pace of computing advancementsto go on indefinitely.We've built entire economies on this idea.And this pace existsbecause of our abilityto pack more and more devicesonto a computer chip.And as those devices get smaller,they get faster, they consume less powerand they get cheaper.And it's this convergencethat gives us this incredible pace. As an example:if I took the room-sized computerthat sent three men to the moon and backand somehow compressed it —compressed the world'sgreatest computer of its day,so it was the same sizeas your smartphone —your actual smartphone,that thing you spent 300 bucks onand just toss out every two years,would blow this thing away.You would not be impressed.It couldn't do anythingthat your smartphone does.It would be slow,you couldn't put any of your stuff on it,you could possiblyget through the first two minutesof a \"Walking Dead\" episodeif you're lucky —n(Laughter) The point is the progress —it's not gradual.The progress is relentless.It's exponential.It compounds on itself year after year,to the point whereif you compare a technologyfrom one generation to the next,they're almost unrecognizable.And we owe it to ourselvesto keep this progress going.We want to say the same thing10, 20, 30 years from now:look what we've doneover the last 30 years.Yet we know this progressmay not last forever.In fact, the party's kind of winding down.It's like \"last call for alcohol,\" right?If you look under the covers,by many metricslike speed and performance,the progress has already slowed to a halt.So if we want to keep this party going,we have to do what we'vealways been able to do,and that is to innovate. So our group's roleand our group's missionis to innovateby employing carbon nanotubes,because we think that they canprovide a path to continue this pace.They are just like they sound.They're tiny, hollow tubesof carbon atoms,and their nanoscale size,that small size,gives rise to thesejust outstanding electronic properties.And the science tells usif we could employ them in computing,we could see up to a ten timesimprovement in performance.It's like skipping through severaltechnology generations in just one step. So there we have it.We have this really important problemand we have what is basicallythe ideal solution.The science is screaming at us,\"This is what you should be doingto solve your problem.\"So, all right, let's get started,let's do this.But you just run right backinto that double-edged sword.This \"ideal solution\" contains a materialthat's impossible to work with.I'd have to arrange billions of themjust to make one single computer chip.It's that same conundrum,it's like this undying problem. At this point, we said, \"Let's just stop.Let's not go down that same road.Let's just figure out what's missing.What are we not dealing with?What are we not doingthat needs to be done?\"It's like in \"The Godfather,\" right?When Fredo betrays his brother Michael,we all know what needs to be done.Fredo's got to go. (Laughter) But Michael — he puts it off.Fine, I get it.Their mother's still alive,it would make her upset.We just said,\"What's the Fredo in our problem?\"What are we not dealing with?What are we not doing,but needs to be doneto make this a success?\"And the answer isthat the statue has to build itself.We have to find a way, somehow,to compel, to convincebillions of these particlesto assemble themselvesinto the technology.We can't do it for them.They have to do it for themselves.And it's the hard way,and this is not trivial,but in this case, it's the only way. Now, as it turns out,this is not that alien of a problem.We just don't build anything this way.People don't build anything this way.But if you look around —and there's examples everywhere —Mother Nature builds everything this way.Everything is built from the bottom up.You can go to the beach,you'll find these simple organismsthat use proteins —basically molecules —to template what is essentially sand,just plucking it from the seaand building these extraordinaryarchitectures with extreme diversity.And nature's not crude like us,just hacking away.She's elegant and smart,building with what's available,molecule by molecule,making structures with a complexityand a diversitythat we can't even approach.And she's already at the nano.She's been therefor hundreds of millions of years.We're the ones that are late to the party. So we decided that we're goingto use the same tool that nature uses,and that's chemistry.Chemistry is the missing tool.And chemistry works in this casebecause these nanoscale objectsare about the same size as molecules,so we can use themto steer these objects around,much like a tool.That's exactly what we've done in our lab.We've developed chemistrythat goes into the pile of dust,into the pile of nanoparticles,and pulls out exactly the ones we need.Then we can use chemistry to arrangeliterally billions of these particlesinto the patternwe need to build circuits.And because we can do that,we can build circuitsthat are many times fasterthan what anyone's been ableto make using nanomaterials before.Chemistry's the missing tool,and every day our tool gets sharperand gets more precise.And eventually —and we hope this iswithin a handful of years —we can deliver on oneof those original promises. Now, computing is just one example.It's the one that I'm interested in,that my group is really invested in,but there are othersin renewable energy, in medicine,in structural materials,where the science is going to tell youto move towards the nano.That's where the biggest benefit is.But if we're going to do that,the scientists of today and tomorroware going to need new tools —tools just like the ones I described.And they will need chemistry.That's the point.The beauty of science is thatonce you develop these new tools,they're out there.They're out there forever,and anyone anywherecan pick them up and use them,and help to deliveron the promise of nanotechnology. Thank you so much for your time.I appreciate it. (Applause) Nearly every other year the transistors that power silicon computer chip shrink in size by half and double in performance, enabling our devices to become more mobile and accessible. But what happens when these components can't get any smaller? George Tulevski researches the unseen and untapped world of nanomaterials. His current work: developing chemical processes to compel billions of carbon nanotubes to assemble themselves into the patterns needed to build circuits, much the same way natural organisms build intricate, diverse and elegant structures.

47	"There is something about physicsthat has been really bothering mesince I was a little kid.And it's related to a questionthat scientists have been askingfor almost 100 years,with no answer.How do the smallest things in nature,the particles of the quantum world,match up with the largestthings in nature —planets and stars and galaxiesheld together by gravity? As a kid, I would puzzleover questions just like this.I would fiddle aroundwith microscopes and electromagnets,and I would readabout the forces of the smalland about quantum mechanicsand I would marvel at how wellthat description matched upto our observation.Then I would look at the stars,and I would read about how wellwe understand gravity,and I would think surely,there must be some elegant waythat these two systems match up.But there's not.And the books would say,yeah, we understand a lotabout these two realms separately,but when we try to linkthem mathematically,everything breaks. And for 100 years,none of our ideas as to how to solvethis basically physics disaster,has ever been supported by evidence.And to little old me —little, curious, skeptical James —this was a supremely unsatisfying answer. So, I'm still a skeptical little kid.Flash-forward nowto December of 2015,when I found myself smack in the middleof the physics worldbeing flipped on its head.It all started when we at CERNsaw something intriguing in our data:a hint of a new particle,an inkling of a possibly extraordinaryanswer to this question. So I'm still a skepticallittle kid, I think,but I'm also now a particle hunter.I am a physicist at CERN'sLarge Hadron Collider,the largest scienceexperiment ever mounted.It's a 27-kilometer tunnelon the border of France and Switzerlandburied 100 meters underground.And in this tunnel,we use superconducting magnetscolder than outer spaceto accelerate protonsto almost the speed of lightand slam them into each othermillions of times per second,collecting the debris of these collisionsto search for new, undiscoveredfundamental particles.Its design and constructiontook decades of workby thousands of physicistsfrom around the globe,and in the summer of 2015,we had been working tirelesslyto switch on the LHCat the highest energy that humanshave ever used in a collider experiment. Now, higher energy is importantbecause for particles,there is an equivalencebetween energy and particle mass,and mass is just a numberput there by nature.To discover new particles,we need to reach these bigger numbers.And to do that, we have to builda bigger, higher energy collider,and the biggest, highestenergy collider in the worldis the Large Hadron Collider.And then, we collide protonsquadrillions of times,and we collect this data very slowly,over months and months.And then new particles might show upin our data as bumps —slight deviations from what you expect,little clusters of data pointsthat make a smooth line not so smooth.For example, this bump,after months of data-taking in 2012,led to the discoveryof the Higgs particle —the Higgs boson —and to a Nobel Prizefor the confirmation of its existence. This jump up in energy in 2015represented the best chancethat we as a species had ever hadof discovering new particles —new answers to theselong-standing questions,because it was almosttwice as much energy as we usedwhen we discovered the Higgs boson.Many of my colleagues had been workingtheir entire careers for this moment,and frankly, to little curious me,this was the momentI'd been waiting for my entire life.So 2015 was go time. So June 2015,the LHC is switched back on.My colleagues and I held our breathand bit our fingernails,and then finally we sawthe first proton collisionsat this highest energy ever.Applause, champagne, celebration.This was a milestone for science,and we had no idea what we would findin this brand-new data.And then a few weeks later,we found a bump.It wasn't a very big bump,but it was big enough to makeyou raise your eyebrow.But on a scale of one to 10for eyebrow raises,if 10 indicates that you'vediscovered a new particle,this eyebrow raise is about a four. (Laughter) I spent hours, days, weeksin secret meetings,arguing with my colleaguesover this little bump,poking and prodding it with our mostruthless experimental sticksto see if it would withstand scrutiny.But even after monthsof working feverishly —sleeping in our officesand not going home,candy bars for dinner,coffee by the bucketful —physicists are machinesfor turning coffee into diagrams —n(Laughter) This little bump would not go away.So after a few months,we presented our little bump to the worldwith a very clear message:this little bump is interestingbut it's not definitive,so let's keep an eye on itas we take more data.So we were trying to beextremely cool about it. And the world ran with it anyway.The news loved it.People said it remindedthem of the little bumpthat was shown on the waytoward the Higgs boson discovery.Better than that,my theorist colleagues —I love my theorist colleagues —my theorist colleagues wrote500 papers about this little bump. (Laughter) The world of particle physicshad been flipped on its head.But what was it about this particular bumpthat caused thousands of physiciststo collectively lose their cool?This little bump was unique.This little bump indicatedthat we were seeing an unexpectedlylarge number of collisionswhose debris consistedof only two photons,two particles of light.And that's rare. Particle collisions are notlike automobile collisions.They have different rules.When two particles collideat almost the speed of light,the quantum world takes over.And in the quantum world,these two particlescan briefly create a new particlethat lives for a tiny fraction of a secondbefore splitting into other particlesthat hit our detector.Imagine a car collisionwhere the two cars vanish upon impact,a bicycle appears in their place —n(Laughter) And then that bicycle explodesinto two skateboards,which hit our detector. (Laughter) Hopefully, not literally.They're very expensive. Events where only two photonshit out detector are very rare.And because of the specialquantum properties of photons,there's a very small numberof possible new particles —these mythical bicycles —that can give birth to only two photons.But one of these options is huge,and it has to do withthat long-standing questionthat bothered me as a tiny little kid,about gravity. Gravity may seem super strong to you,but it's actually crazily weakcompared to the other forces of nature.I can briefly beat gravity when I jump,but I can't pick a proton out of my hand.The strength of gravity comparedto the other forces of nature?It's 10 to the minus 39.That's a decimal with 39 zeros after it. Worse than that,all of the other known forces of natureare perfectly describedby this thing we call the Standard Model,which is our current best descriptionof nature at its smallest scales,and quite frankly,one of the most successfulachievements of humankind —except for gravity, which is absentfrom the Standard Model.It's crazy.It's almost as though mostof gravity has gone missing.We feel a little bit of it,but where's the rest of it?No one knows. But one theoretical explanationproposes a wild solution.You and I —even you in the back —we live in three dimensions of space.I hope that's anon-controversial statement. (Laughter) All of the known particles also livein three dimensions of space.In fact, a particle is just another namefor an excitationin a three-dimensional field;a localized wobbling in space.More importantly, all the maththat we use to describe all this stuffassumes that there are onlythree dimensions of space.But math is math, and we can playaround with our math however we want.And people have been playing aroundwith extra dimensions of spacefor a very long time,but it's always been an abstractmathematical concept.I mean, just look around you —you at the back, look around —there's clearly onlythree dimensions of space. But what if that's not true?What if the missing gravity is leakinginto an extra-spatial dimensionthat's invisible to you and I?What if gravity is just as strongas the other forcesif you were to view it in thisextra-spatial dimension,and what you and I experienceis a tiny slice of gravitymake it seem very weak?If this were true,we would have to expandour Standard Model of particlesto include an extra particle,a hyperdimensional particle of gravity,a special graviton that livesin extra-spatial dimensions. I see the looks on your faces.You should be asking me the question,\"How in the world are we going to testthis crazy, science fiction idea,stuck as we are in three dimensions?\"The way we always do,by slamming together two protons —n(Laughter) Hard enough thatthe collision reverberatesinto any extra-spatial dimensionsthat might be there,momentarily creatingthis hyperdimensional gravitonthat then snaps backinto the three dimensions of the LHCand spits off two photons,two particles of light.And this hypothetical,extra-dimensional gravitonis one of the only possible,hypothetical new particlesthat has the special quantum propertiesthat could give birth to our little,two-photon bump. So, the possibility of explainingthe mysteries of gravityand of discovering extradimensions of space —perhaps now you get a senseas to why thousands of physics geekscollectively lost their coolover our little, two-photon bump.A discovery of this typewould rewrite the textbooks.But remember,the message from us experimentaliststhat actually were doingthis work at the time,was very clear:we need more data.With more data,the little bump will either turn intoa nice, crisp Nobel Prize —n(Laughter) Or the extra data will fill inthe space around the bumpand turn it into a nice, smooth line. So we took more data,and with five times the data,several months later,our little bumpturned into a smooth line.The news reported on a \"hugedisappointment,\" on \"faded hopes,\"and on particle physicists \"being sad.\"Given the tone of the coverage,you'd think that we had decidedto shut down the LHC and go home. (Laughter) But that's not what we did.But why not?I mean, if I didn't discovera particle — and I didn't —if I didn't discover a particle,why am I here talking to you?Why didn't I just hang my head in shameand go home? Particle physicists are explorers.And very much of what we dois cartography.Let me put it this way: forgetabout the LHC for a second.Imagine you are a space explorerarriving at a distant planet,searching for aliens.What is your first task?To immediately orbit the planet,land, take a quick look aroundfor any big, obvious signs of life,and report back to home base.That's the stage we're at now.We took a first look at the LHCfor any new, big,obvious-to-spot particles,and we can report that there are none.We saw a weird-looking alien bumpon a distant mountain,but once we got closer,we saw it was a rock. But then what do we do?Do we just give up and fly away?Absolutely not;we would be terrible scientists if we did.No, we spend the next coupleof decades exploring,mapping out the territory,sifting through the sandwith a fine instrument,peeking under every stone,drilling under the surface.New particles can eithershow up immediatelyas big, obvious-to-spot bumps,or they can only reveal themselvesafter years of data taking. Humanity has just begun its explorationat the LHC at this big high energy,and we have much searching to do.But what if, even after 10 or 20 years,we still find no new particles?We build a bigger machine. (Laughter) We search at higher energies.We search at higher energies.Planning is already underwayfor a 100-kilometer tunnelthat will collide particlesat 10 times the energy of the LHC.We don't decide wherenature places new particles.We only decide to keep exploring.But what if, even aftera 100-kilometer tunnelor a 500-kilometer tunnelor a 10,000-kilometercollider floating in spacebetween the Earth and the Moon,we still find no new particles?Then perhaps we're doingparticle physics wrong. (Laughter) Perhaps we need to rethink things.Maybe we need more resources,technology, expertisethan what we currently have.We already use artificial intelligenceand machine learning techniquesin parts of the LHC,but imagine designinga particle physics experimentusing such sophisticated algorithmsthat it could teach itself to discovera hyperdimensional graviton. But what if?What if the ultimate question:What if even artificial intelligencecan't help us answer our questions?What if these open questions,for centuries,are destined to be unansweredfor the foreseeable future?What if the stuff that's bothered mesince I was a little kidis destined to be unansweredin my lifetime?Then that ...will be even more fascinating. We will be forced to thinkin completely new ways.We'll have to go back to our assumptions,and determine if there wasa flaw somewhere.And we'll need to encourage more peopleto join us in studying sciencesince we need fresh eyeson these century-old problems.I don't have the answers,and I'm still searching for them.But someone — maybeshe's in school right now,maybe she's not even born yet —could eventually guide us to see physicsin a completely new way,and to point out that perhapswe're just asking the wrong questions.Which would not be the end of physics,but a novel beginning. Thank you. (Applause) James Beacham looks for answers to the most important open questions of physics using the biggest science experiment ever mounted, CERN's Large Hadron Collider.

50	"I'm going to talk a little bitabout where technology's going.And often technology comes to us,we're surprised by what it brings.But there's actuallya large aspect of technologythat's much more predictable,and that's because technological systemsof all sorts have leanings,they have urgencies,they have tendencies.And those tendencies are derivedfrom the very nature of the physics,chemistry of wiresand switches and electrons,and they will make reoccurringpatterns again and again.And so those patterns producethese tendencies, these leanings. You can almost think of itas sort of like gravity.Imagine raindrops falling into a valley.The actual path of a raindropas it goes down the valleyis unpredictable.We cannot see where it's going,but the general directionis very inevitable:it's downward.And so these baked-intendencies and urgenciesin technological systemsgive us a sense of where thingsare going at the large form.So in a large sense,I would say that telephoneswere inevitable,but the iPhone was not.The Internet was inevitable,but Twitter was not. So we have many ongoingtendencies right now,and I think one of the chief among themis this tendency to make thingssmarter and smarter.I call it cognifying — cognification —also known as artificialintelligence, or AI.And I think that's going to be oneof the most influential developmentsand trends and directions and drivesin our society in the next 20 years. So, of course, it's already here.We already have AI,and often it works in the background,in the back offices of hospitals,where it's used to diagnose X-raysbetter than a human doctor.It's in legal offices,where it's used to gothrough legal evidencebetter than a human paralawyer.It's used to fly the planethat you came here with.Human pilots only flew itseven to eight minutes,the rest of the time the AI was driving.And of course, in Netflix and Amazon,it's in the background,making those recommendations.That's what we have today. And we have an example, of course,in a more front-facing aspect of it,with the win of the AlphaGo, who beatthe world's greatest Go champion.But it's more than that.If you play a video game,you're playing against an AI.But recently, Google taught their AIto actually learn how to play video games.Again, teaching video gameswas already done,but learning how to playa video game is another step.That's artificial smartness.What we're doing is takingthis artificial smartnessand we're making it smarter and smarter. There are three aspectsto this general trendthat I think are underappreciated;I think we would understandAI a lot betterif we understood these three things.I think these things also wouldhelp us embrace AI,because it's only by embracing itthat we actually can steer it.We can actually steer the specificsby embracing the larger trend. So let me talk aboutthose three different aspects.The first one is: our own intelligencehas a very poor understandingof what intelligence is.We tend to think of intelligenceas a single dimension,that it's kind of like a notethat gets louder and louder.It starts like with IQ measurement.It starts with maybe a simplelow IQ in a rat or mouse,and maybe there's more in a chimpanzee,and then maybe there's morein a stupid person,and then maybe an averageperson like myself,and then maybe a genius.And this single IQ intelligenceis getting greater and greater.That's completely wrong.That's not what intelligence is —not what human intelligence is, anyway.It's much more like a symphonyof different notes,and each of these notes is playedon a different instrument of cognition. There are many typesof intelligences in our own minds.We have deductive reasoning,we have emotional intelligence,we have spatial intelligence;we have maybe 100 different typesthat are all grouped together,and they vary in different strengthswith different people.And of course, if we go to animals,they also have another basket —another symphony of differentkinds of intelligences,and sometimes those same instrumentsare the same that we have.They can think in the same way,but they may have a different arrangement,and maybe they're higherin some cases than humans,like long-term memory in a squirrelis actually phenomenal,so it can rememberwhere it buried its nuts.But in other cases they may be lower. When we go to make machines,we're going to engineerthem in the same way,where we'll make some of those typesof smartness much greater than ours,and many of them won't beanywhere near ours,because they're not needed.So we're going to take these things,these artificial clusters,and we'll be adding more varietiesof artificial cognition to our AIs.We're going to make themvery, very specific. So your calculator is smarterthan you are in arithmetic already;your GPS is smarterthan you are in spatial navigation;Google, Bing, are smarterthan you are in long-term memory.And we're going to take, again,these kinds of different types of thinkingand we'll put them into, like, a car.The reason why we want to put themin a car so the car drives,is because it's not driving like a human.It's not thinking like us.That's the whole feature of it.It's not being distracted,it's not worrying about whetherit left the stove on,or whether it should havemajored in finance.It's just driving. (Laughter) Just driving, OK?And we actually might evencome to advertise theseas \"consciousness-free.\"They're without consciousness,they're not concerned about those things,they're not distracted. So in general, what we're trying to dois make as many differenttypes of thinking as we can.We're going to populate the spaceof all the different possible types,or species, of thinking.And there actually may be some problemsthat are so difficultin business and sciencethat our own type of human thinkingmay not be able to solve them alone.We may need a two-step program,which is to invent new kinds of thinkingthat we can work alongside of to solvethese really large problems,say, like dark energy or quantum gravity. What we're doingis making alien intelligences.You might even think of thisas, sort of, artificial aliensin some senses.And they're going to helpus think different,because thinking differentis the engine of creationand wealth and new economy. The second aspect of thisis that we are going to use AIto basically make a secondIndustrial Revolution.The first Industrial Revolutionwas based on the factthat we invented somethingI would call artificial power.Previous to that,during the Agricultural Revolution,everything that was madehad to be made with human muscleor animal power.That was the only wayto get anything done.The great innovation duringthe Industrial Revolution was,we harnessed steam power, fossil fuels,to make this artificial powerthat we could useto do anything we wanted to do.So today when you drive down the highway,you are, with a flick of the switch,commanding 250 horses —250 horsepower —which we can use to build skyscrapers,to build cities, to build roads,to make factories that would churn outlines of chairs or refrigeratorsway beyond our own power.And that artificial power can alsobe distributed on wires on a gridto every home, factory, farmstead,and anybody could buythat artificial power,just by plugging something in. So this was a sourceof innovation as well,because a farmer could takea manual hand pump,and they could add this artificialpower, this electricity,and he'd have an electric pump.And you multiply that by thousandsor tens of thousands of times,and that formula was what brought usthe Industrial Revolution.All the things that we see,all this progress that we now enjoy,has come from the factthat we've done that. We're going to dothe same thing now with AI.We're going to distribute that on a grid,and now you can take that electric pump.You can add some artificial intelligence,and now you have a smart pump.And that, multiplied by a million times,is going to be this secondIndustrial Revolution.So now the car is going down the highway,it's 250 horsepower,but in addition, it's 250 minds.That's the auto-driven car.It's like a new commodity;it's a new utility.The AI is going to flowacross the grid — the cloud —in the same way electricity did. So everything that we had electrified,we're now going to cognify.And I would suggest, then,that the formulafor the next 10,000 start-upsis very, very simple,which is to take x and add AI.That is the formula,that's what we're going to be doing.And that is the wayin which we're going to makethis second Industrial Revolution.And by the way — right now, this minute,you can log on to Googleand you can purchaseAI for six cents, 100 hits.That's available right now. So the third aspect of thisis that when we take this AIand embody it,we get robots.And robots are going to be bots,they're going to be doing manyof the tasks that we have already done.A job is just a bunch of tasks,so they're going to redefine our jobsbecause they're going to dosome of those tasks.But they're also going to createwhole new categories,a whole new slew of tasksthat we didn't knowwe wanted to do before.They're going to actuallyengender new kinds of jobs,new kinds of tasks that we want done,just as automation made upa whole bunch of new thingsthat we didn't know we needed before,and now we can't live without them.So they're going to produceeven more jobs than they take away,but it's important that a lot of the tasksthat we're going to give themare tasks that can be definedin terms of efficiency or productivity.If you can specify a task,either manual or conceptual,that can be specified in termsof efficiency or productivity,that goes to the bots.Productivity is for robots.What we're really good atis basically wasting time. (Laughter) We're really good at thingsthat are inefficient.Science is inherently inefficient.It runs on that fact that you haveone failure after another.It runs on the fact that you make testsand experiments that don't work,otherwise you're not learning.It runs on the factthat there is nota lot of efficiency in it.Innovation by definition is inefficient,because you make prototypes,because you try stuff that fails,that doesn't work.Exploration is inherently inefficiency.Art is not efficient.Human relationships are not efficient.These are all the kinds of thingswe're going to gravitate to,because they're not efficient.Efficiency is for robots.We're also going to learnthat we're going to work with these AIsbecause they think differently than us. When Deep Blue beatthe world's best chess champion,people thought it was the end of chess.But actually, it turns out that today,the best chess champion in the worldis not an AI.And it's not a human.It's the team of a human and an AI.The best medical diagnosticianis not a doctor, it's not an AI,it's the team.We're going to be working with these AIs,and I think you'll be paid in the futureby how well you work with these bots.So that's the third thing,is that they're different,they're utilityand they are going to be somethingwe work with rather than against.We're working with theserather than against them. So, the future:Where does that take us?I think that 25 years from now,they'll look backand look at our understandingof AI and say,\"You didn't have AI. In fact,you didn't even have the Internet yet,compared to what we're goingto have 25 years from now.\"There are no AI experts right now.There's a lot of money going to it,there are billions of dollarsbeing spent on it;it's a huge business,but there are no experts, comparedto what we'll know 20 years from now.So we are just at the beginningof the beginning,we're in the first hour of all this.We're in the first hour of the Internet.We're in the first hour of what's coming.The most popular AI productin 20 years from now,that everybody uses,has not been invented yet.That means that you're not late. Thank you. (Laughter) (Applause) \"The actual path of a raindrop as it goes down the valley is unpredictable, but the general direction is inevitable,\" says digital visionary Kevin Kelly — and technology is much the same, driven by patterns that are surprising but inevitable. Over the next 20 years, he says, our penchant for making things smarter and smarter will have a profound impact on nearly everything we do. Kelly explores three trends in AI we need to understand in order to embrace it and steer its development. \"The most popular AI product 20 years from now that everyone uses has not been invented yet,\" Kelly says. \"That means that you're not late.\"nThere may be no one better to contemplate the meaning of cultural change than Kevin Kelly, whose life story reads like a treatise on the value and impacts of technology.

51	"When I was six years old,I received my gifts.My first grade teacherhad this brilliant idea.She wanted us to experiencereceiving giftsbut also learning the virtueof complimenting each other.So she had all of uscome to the front of the classroom,and she bought all of us giftsand stacked them in the corner.And she said,\"Why don't we just stand hereand compliment each other?If you hear your name called,go and pick up your gift and sit down.\"What a wonderful idea, right?What could go wrong? (Laughter) Well, there were 40 of us to start with,and every time I heardsomeone's name called,I would give out the heartiest cheer.And then there were 20 people left,and 10 people left,and five left ...and three left.And I was one of them.And the compliments stopped.Well, at that moment, I was crying.And the teacher was freaking out.She was like, \"Hey, would anyonesay anything nice about these people?\"n(Laughter) \"No one? OK, why don't yougo get your gift and sit down.So behave next year —someone might saysomething nice about you.\"n(Laughter) Well, as I'm describing this you,you probably knowI remember this really well. (Laughter) But I don't know who felt worse that day.Was it me or the teacher?She must have realizedthat she turned a team-building eventinto a public roastfor three six-year-olds.And without the humor.You know, when you seepeople get roasted on TV,it was funny.There was nothing funny about that day. So that was one version of me,and I would die to avoidbeing in that situation again —to get rejected in public again.That's one version.Then fast-forward eight years.Bill Gates came to my hometown —Beijing, China —to speak,and I saw his message.I fell in love with that guy.I thought, wow,I know what I want to do now.That night I wrote a letter to my familytelling them: \"By age 25,I will build the biggestcompany in the world,and that company will buy Microsoft.\"n(Laughter) I totally embraced this ideaof conquering the world —domination, right?And I didn't make this up,I did write that letter.And here it is —n(Laughter) You don't have to read this through —n(Laughter) This is also bad handwriting,but I did highlight some key words.You get the idea. (Laughter) So ...that was another version of me:one who will conquer the world. Well, then two years later,I was presented with the opportunityto come to the United States.I jumped on it,because that waswhere Bill Gates lived, right? (Laughter) I thought that was the startof my entrepreneur journey.Then, fast-forward another 14 years.I was 30.Nope, I didn't build that company.I didn't even start.I was actually a marketing managerfor a Fortune 500 company.And I felt I was stuck;I was stagnant.Why is that?Where is that 14-year-oldwho wrote that letter?It's not because he didn't try.It's because every time I had a new idea,every time I wanted to try something new,even at work —I wanted to make a proposal,I wanted to speak upin front of people in a group —I felt there was this constant battlebetween the 14-year-oldand the six-year-old.One wanted to conquer the world —make a difference —another was afraid of rejection.And every time that six-year-old won. And this fear even persistedafter I started my own company.I mean, I startedmy own company when I was 30 —if you want to be Bill Gates,you've got to startsooner or later, right?When I was an entrepreneur,I was presentedwith an investment opportunity,and then I was turned down.And that rejection hurt me.It hurt me so badthat I wanted to quit right there.But then I thought,hey, would Bill Gates quitafter a simple investment rejection?Would any successfulentrepreneur quit like that?No way.And this is where it clicked for me.OK, I can build a better company.I can build a betterteam or better product,but one thing for sure:I've got to be a better leader.I've got to be a better person.I cannot let that six-year-oldkeep dictating my life anymore.I have to put him back in his place. So this is where I went onlineand looked for help.Google was my friend. (Laughter) I searched, \"How do I overcomethe fear of rejection?\"I came up with a bunchof psychology articlesabout where the fearand pain are coming from.Then I came up with a bunchof \"rah-rah\" inspirational articlesabout \"Don't take it personally,just overcome it.\"Who doesn't know that? (Laughter) But why was I still so scared?Then I found this website by luck.It's called rejectiontherapy.com. (Laughter) \"Rejection Therapy\" was this gameinvented by this Canadian entrepreneur.His name is Jason Comely.And basically the idea is for 30 daysyou go out and look for rejection,and every day get rejected at something,and then by the end,you desensitize yourself from the pain.And I loved that idea. (Laughter) I said, \"You know what?I'm going to do this.And I'll feel myselfgetting rejected 100 days.\"And I came up with my own rejection ideas,and I made a video blog out of it. And so here's what I did.This is what the blog looked like.Day One ... (Laughter) Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger.So this is where I wentto where I was working.I came downstairsand I saw this big guysitting behind a desk.He looked like a security guard.So I just approached him.And I was just walkingand that was the longestwalk of my life —hair on the backof my neck standing up,I was sweating and my heart was pounding.And I got there and said,\"Hey, sir, can I borrow100 dollars from you?\"n(Laughter) And he looked up, he's like, \"No.\"\"Why?\"nAnd I just said, \"No? I'm sorry.\"Then I turned around,and I just ran. (Laughter) I felt so embarrassed.But because I filmed myself —so that night I was watchingmyself getting rejected,I just saw how scared I was.I looked like this kidin \"The Sixth Sense.\"I saw dead people. (Laughter) But then I saw this guy.You know, he wasn't that menacing.He was a chubby, loveable guy,and he even asked me, \"Why?\"In fact, he invited me to explain myself.And I could've said many things.I could've explained,I could've negotiated.I didn't do any of that.All I did was run.I felt, wow, this is likea microcosm of my life.Every time I felt the slightest rejection,I would just run as fast as I could.And you know what?The next day, no matter what happens,I'm not going to run.I'll stay engaged. Day Two: Request a \"burger refill.\"n(Laughter) It's when I went to a burger joint,I finished lunch,and I went to the cashier and said,\"Hi, can I get a burger refill?\"n(Laughter) He was all confused,like, \"What's a burger refill?\"n(Laughter) I said, \"Well, it's just likea drink refill but with a burger.\"And he said, \"Sorry,we don't do burger refill, man.\"n(Laughter) So this is where rejection happenedand I could have run, but I stayed.I said, \"Well, I love your burgers,I love your joint,and if you guys do a burger refill,I will love you guys more.\"n(Laughter) And he said, \"Well, OK,I'll tell my manager about it,and maybe we'll do it,but sorry, we can't do this today.\"Then I left.And by the way,I don't think they'veever done burger refill. (Laughter) I think they're still there.But the life and death feelingI was feeling the first timewas no longer there,just because I stayed engaged —because I didn't run.I said, \"Wow, great,I'm already learning things.Great.\"nAnd then Day Three:Getting Olympic Doughnuts.This is where my lifewas turned upside down.I went to a Krispy Kreme.It's a doughnut shopin mainly the Southeastern partof the United States.I'm sure they have some here, too.And I went in,I said, \"Can you make me doughnutsthat look like Olympic symbols?Basically, you interlinkfive doughnuts together ... \"I mean there's no waythey could say yes, right?The doughnut maker took me so seriously. (Laughter) So she put out paper,started jotting downthe colors and the rings,and is like, \"How can I make this?\"And then 15 minutes later,she came out with a boxthat looked like Olympic rings.And I was so touched.I just couldn't believe it.And that video gotover five million views on Youtube.The world couldn't believe that either. (Laughter) You know, because of thatI was in newspapers,in talk shows, in everything.And I became famous.A lot of peoplestarted writing emails to meand saying, \"What you'redoing is awesome.\"But you know, fame and notorietydid not do anything to me.What I really wanted to do was learn,and to change myself.So I turned the restof my 100 days of rejectioninto this playground —into this research project.I wanted to see what I could learn. And then I learned a lot of things.I discovered so many secrets.For example, I found if I just don't run,if I got rejected,I could actually turn a \"no\" into a \"yes,\"and the magic word is, \"why.\"nSo one day I went to a stranger's house,I had this flower in my hand,knocked on the door and said,\"Hey, can I plant this flowerin your backyard?\"n(Laughter) And he said, \"No.\"But before he could leave I said,\"Hey, can I know why?\"And he said, \"Well, I have this dogthat would dig upanything I put in the backyard.I don't want to waste your flower.If you want to do this,go across the street and talk to Connie.She loves flowers.\"So that's what I did.I went across and knockedon Connie's door.And she was so happy to see me. (Laughter) And then half an hour later,there was this flowerin Connie's backyard.I'm sure it looks better now. (Laughter) But had I leftafter the initial rejection,I would've thought,well, it's becausethe guy didn't trust me,it's because I was crazy,because I didn't dress up well,I didn't look good.It was none of those.It was because what I offereddid not fit what he wanted.And he trusted me enoughto offer me a referral,using a sales term.I converted a referral. Then one day —and I also learned that I canactually say certain thingsand maximize my chance to get a yes.So for example,one day I went to a Starbucks,and asked the manager,\"Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?\"He was like, \"What's a Starbucks greeter?\"I said, \"Do you knowthose Walmart greeters?You know, those people who say'hi' to you before you walk in the store,and make sure youdon't steal stuff, basically?I want to give a Walmart experienceto Starbucks customers.\"n(Laughter) Well, I'm not surethat's a good thing, actually —Actually, I'm pretty sureit's a bad thing.And he was like, \"Oh\" —yeah, this is how he looked,his name is Eric —and he was like, \"I'm not sure.\"This is how he was hearing me. \"Not sure.\"Then I ask him, \"Is that weird?\"He's like, \"Yeah, it's really weird, man.\"But as soon as he said that,his whole demeanor changed.It's as if he's puttingall the doubt on the floor.And he said, \"Yeah, you can do this,just don't get too weird.\"n(Laughter) So for the next hourI was the Starbucks greeter.I said \"hi\" to every customerthat walked in,and gave them holiday cheers.By the way, I don't knowwhat your career trajectory is,don't be a greeter. (Laughter) It was really boring.But then I found I could do thisbecause I mentioned, \"Is that weird?\"I mentioned the doubt that he was having.And because I mentioned, \"Is that weird?\",that means I wasn't weird.That means I was actuallythinking just like him,seeing this as a weird thing.And again, and again,I learned that if I mentionsome doubt people might havebefore I ask the question,I gained their trust.People were more likely to say yes to me. And then I learnedI could fulfill my life dream ...by asking.You know, I camefrom four generations of teachers,and my grandma has always told me,\"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want,but it'd be greatif you became a teacher.\"n(Laughter) But I wanted to bean entrepreneur, so I didn't.But it has always been my dreamto actually teach something.So I said, \"What if I just askand teach a college class?\"I lived in Austin at the time,so I went to Universityof Texas at Austinand knocked on professors' doorsand said, \"Can I teach your class?\"I didn't get anywherethe first couple of times.But because I didn't run —I kept doing it —and on the third trythe professor was very impressed.He was like, \"No onehas done this before.\"And I came in preparedwith powerpoints and my lesson.He said, \"Wow, I can use this.Why don't you come back in two months?I'll fit you in my curriculum.\"And two months laterI was teaching a class. This is me — you probably can't see,this is a bad picture.You know, sometimes you getrejected by lighting, you know? (Laughter) But wow —when I finished teaching that class,I walked out crying,because I thoughtI could fulfill my life dreamjust by simply asking.I used to think I have to accomplishall these things —have to be a great entrepreneur,or get a PhD to teach —but no, I just asked,and I could teach. And in that picture,which you can't see,I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.Why? Because in my research I foundthat people who really change the world,who change the way we liveand the way we think,are the people who were metwith initial and often violent rejections.People like Martin Luther King, Jr.,like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,or even Jesus Christ.These people did notlet rejection define them.They let their own reactionafter rejection define themselves.And they embraced rejection. And we don't have to be those peopleto learn about rejection,and in my case,rejection was my curse,was my boogeyman.It has bothered me my whole lifebecause I was running away from it.Then I started embracing it.I turned that intothe biggest gift in my life.I started teaching peoplehow to turn rejections into opportunities.I use my blog, I use my talk,I use the book I just published,and I'm even building technology to helppeople overcome their fear of rejection. When you get rejected in life,when you are facing the next obstacleor next failure,consider the possibilities.Don't run.If you just embrace them,they might become your gifts as well. Thank you. (Applause) Jia Jiang adventures boldly into a territory so many of us fear: rejection. By seeking out rejection for 100 days — from asking a stranger to borrow $100 to requesting a \"burger refill\" at a restaurant — Jiang desensitized himself to the pain and shame that rejection often brings and, in the process, discovered that simply asking for what you want can open up possibilities where you expect to find dead ends. Jia Jiang's journey through rejection revealed a world hidden in plain sight, where people are much kinder than we imagine.

52	"It's easy to forget that last night,one billion people went to sleepwithout access to electricity.One billion people.Two and a half billion peopledid not have access to clean cooking fuelsor clean heating fuels.Those are the problemsin the developing world.And it's easy for us not to be empatheticwith those peoplewho seem so distanced from us. But even in our own world,the developed world,we see the tension of stagnant economiesimpacting the lives of people around us.We see it in whole pieces of the economy,where the people involvedhave lost hope about the futureand despair about the present.We see that in the Brexit vote.We see that in the Sanders/Trumpcampaigns in my own country.But even in countries as recentlyturning the cornertowards being in the developed world,in China,we see the difficultythat President Xi hasas he begins to un-employ so many peoplein his coal and mining industrieswho see no future for themselves.As we as a societyfigure out how to managethe problems of the developed worldand the problems of the developing world,we have to look at how we move forwardand manage the environmental impactof those decisions. We've been working on this problemfor 25 years, since Rio,the Kyoto Protocols.Our most recent move is the Paris treaty,and the resulting climate agreementsthat are being ratifiedby nations around the world.I think we can be very hopefulthat those agreements,which are bottom-up agreements,where nations have saidwhat they think they can do,are genuine and forthcomingfor the vast majority of the parties.The unfortunate thingis that now, as we lookat the independent analysesof what those climate treatiesare liable to yield,the magnitude of the problembefore us becomes clear. This is the United StatesEnergy Information Agency's assessmentof what will happen if the countriesimplement the climate commitmentsthat they've made in Parisbetween now and 2040.It shows basically CO2 emissionsaround the worldover the next 30 years.There are three things that you needto look at and appreciate. One, CO2 emissions are expectedto continue to growfor the next 30 years.In order to control climate,CO2 emissions have to literally go to zerobecause it's the cumulative emissionsthat drive heating on the planet.This should tell you that we are losingthe race to fossil fuels. The second thing you should noticeis that the bulk of the growthcomes from the developing countries,from China, from India,from the rest of the world,which includes South Africaand Indonesia and Brazil,as most of these countriesmove their peopleinto the lower range of lifestylesthat we literally take for grantedin the developed world. The final thing that you should noticeis that each year,about 10 gigatons of carbon are gettingadded to the planet's atmosphere,and then diffusing into the oceanand into the land.That's on top of the 550 gigatonsthat are in place today.At the end of 30 years,we will have put 850 gigatonsof carbon into the air,and that probably goes a long waytowards locking in a 2-4 degree C increasein global mean surface temperatures,locking in ocean acidificationand locking in sea level rise. Now, this is a projection made by menby the actions of society,and it's ours to change, not to accept.But the magnitude of the problemis something we need to appreciate. Different nations makedifferent energy choices.It's a functionof their natural resources.It's a function of their climate.It's a function of the development paththat they've followed as a society.It's a function of whereon the surface of the planet they are.Are they where it's darka lot of the time,or are they at the mid-latitudes?Many, many, many thingsgo into the choices of countries,and they each make a different choice. The overwhelming thingthat we need to appreciateis the choice that China has made.China has made the choice,and will make the choice, to run on coal.The United States has an alternative.It can run on natural gasas a result of the inventionsof fracking and shale gas,which we have here.They provide an alternative.The OECD Europe has a choice.It has renewables that it can affordto deploy in Germanybecause it's rich enoughto afford to do it.The French and the Britishshow interest in nuclear power.Eastern Europe, still very heavilycommitted to natural gas and to coal,and with natural gasthat comes from Russia,with all of its entanglements.China has many fewer choicesand a much harder row to hoe. If you look at China, and you ask yourselfwhy has coal been important to it,you have to remember what China's done.China brought people to power,not power to people.It didn't do rural electrification.It urbanized.It urbanized by taking low-cost laborand low-cost energy,creating export industriesthat could fund a tremendousamount of growth. If we look at China's path,all of us know that prosperity in Chinahas dramatically increased.In 1980, 80 percent of China's populationlived below the extreme poverty level,below the level of having$1.90 per person per day.By the year 2000, only 20 percentof China's populationlived below the extreme poverty level —a remarkable feat,admittedly, with some costsin civil libertiesthat would be tough to acceptin the Western world.But the impact of all that wealthallowed people to getmassively better nutrition.It allowed water pipes to be placed.It allowed sewage pipes to be placed,dramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases,at the cost of some outdoor air pollution. But in 1980, and even today,the number one killer in Chinais indoor air pollution,because people do not have accessto clean cooking and heating fuels.In fact, in 2040,it's still estimatedthat 200 million people in Chinawill not have accessto clean cooking fuels.They have a remarkable path to follow. India also needs to meet the needsof its own people,and it's going to do that by burning coal.When we look at the EIA's projectionsof coal burning in India,India will supply nearly four timesas much of its energy from coalas it will from renewables.It's not because they don't knowthe alternatives;it's because rich countriescan do what they choose,poor countries do what they must. So what can we do to stopcoal's emissions in time?What can we do that changesthis forecast that's in front of us?Because it's a forecast that we can changeif we have the will to do it. First of all, we have to thinkabout the magnitude of the problem.Between now and 2040,800 to 1,600 new coal plantsare going to be built around the world.This week, between one and threeone-gigawatt coal plantsare being turned on around the world.That's happening regardlessof what we want,because the peoplethat rule their countries,assessing the interests of their citizens,have decided it's in the interestof their citizens to do that.And that's going to happenunless they have a better alternative.And every 100 of those plants will use upbetween one percent and three percentof the Earth's climate budget. So every day that you go homethinking that you should do somethingabout global warming,at the end of that week, remember:somebody fired up a coal plantthat's going to run for 50 yearsand take away your ability to change it. What we've forgotten is somethingthat Vinod Khosla used to talk about,a man of Indian ethnicitybut an American venture capitalist.And he said, back in the early 2000s,that if you needed to getChina and India off of fossil fuels,you had to create a technologythat passed the \"Chindia test,\"\"Chindia\" being the appendingof the two words.It had to be first of all viable,meaning that technically, they couldimplement it in their country,and that it would be acceptedby the people in the country. Two, it had to be a technologythat was scalable,that it could deliver the same benefitson the same timetable as fossil fuels,so that they can enjoy the kind of life,again, that we take for granted. And third, it had to be cost-effectivewithout subsidy or without mandate.It had to stand on its own two feet;it could not be maintainedfor that many peopleif in fact, those countrieshad to go beggingor had some foreign country say,\"I won't trade with you,\"in order to getthe technology shift to occur. If you look at the Chindia test,we simply have not come upwith alternatives that meet that test.That's what the EIA forecast tells us.China's building 800 gigawatts of coal,400 gigawatts of hydro,about 200 gigawatts of nuclear,and on an energy-equivalent basis,adjusting for intermittency,about 100 gigawatts of renewables.800 gigawatts of coal.They're doing that, knowing the costsbetter than any other country,knowing the need betterthan any other country.But that's what they're aiming for in 2040unless we give them a better choice.To give them a better choice,it's going to have to meetthe Chindia test. If you look at all the alternativesthat are out there,there are really twothat come near to meeting it.First is this area of new nuclearthat I'll talk about in just a second.It's a new generation of nuclear plantsthat are on the drawing boardsaround the world,and the people who aredeveloping these saywe can get themin position to demo by 2025and to scale by 2030,if you will just let us.The second alternativethat could be there in timeis utility-scale solarbacked up with natural gas,which we can use today,versus the batterieswhich are still under development. So what's holding new nuclear back?Outdated regulationsand yesterday's mindsets.We have not used our latestscientific thinking on radiological healthto think how we communicatewith the publicand govern the testingof new nuclear reactors.We have new scientific knowledgethat we need to usein order to improve the waywe regulate nuclear industry. The second thing is we've got a mindsetthat it takes 25 yearsand 2 to 5 billion dollarsto develop a nuclear power plant.That comes from the historical,military mindsetof the places nuclear power came from.These new nuclear ventures are sayingthat they can deliver powerfor 5 cents a kilowatt hour;they can deliver itfor 100 gigawatts a year;they can demo it by 2025;and they can deliver it in scale by 2030,if only we give them a chance. Right now, we're basicallywaiting for a miracle.What we need is a choice.If they can't make it safe,if they can't make it cheap,it should not be deployed.But what I want you to dois not carry an idea forward,but write your leaders,write the head of the NGOs you support,and tell them to give you the choice,not the past. Thank you very much. (Applause) Joe Lassiter is a deep thinker and straight talker focused on developing clean, secure and carbon-neutral supplies of reliable, low-cost energy. His analysis of the world's energy realities puts a powerful lens on the stubbornly touchy issue of nuclear power, including new designs for plants that can compete economically with fossil fuels. We have the potential to make nuclear safer and cheaper than it's been in the past, Lassiter says. Now we have to make the choice to pursue it. Joe Lassiter focuses on one of the world’s most pressing problems: developing clean, secure and carbon-neutral supplies of reliable, low-cost energy all around the world.

53	"Here's a question that matters. [Is it ethical to evolve the human body?]nBecause we're beginning to get allthe tools together to evolve ourselves.And we can evolve bacteriaand we can evolve plantsand we can evolve animals,and we're now reaching a pointwhere we really have to ask,is it really ethicaland do we want to evolve human beings?And as you're thinking about that,let me talk about thatin the context of prosthetics,prosthetics past, present, future. So this is the iron handthat belonged to one of the German counts.Loved to fight, lost his armin one of these battles.No problem, he just made a suit of armor,put it on,perfect prosthetic.That's where the conceptof ruling with an iron fist comes from. And of course these prostheticshave been getting more and more useful,more and more modern.You can hold soft-boiled eggs.You can have all types of controls,and as you're thinking about that,there are wonderful people like Hugh Herrwho have been buildingabsolutely extraordinary prosthetics.So the wonderful Aimee Mullinswill go out and say,how tall do I want to be tonight?Or Hugh will say what type of cliffdo I want to climb?Or does somebody want to run a marathon,or does somebody want to ballroom dance?And as you adapt these things,the interesting thing about prostheticsis they've been coming inside the body.So these external prostheticshave now become artificial knees.They've become artificial hips.And then they've evolved furtherto become not just nice to havebut essential to have. So when you're talkingabout a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic,you're talking about somethingthat isn't just, \"I'm missing my leg,\"it's, \"if I don't have this, I can die.\"And at that point, a prostheticbecomes a symbiotic relationshipwith the human body. And four of the smartest peoplethat I've ever met —Ed Boyden, Hugh Herr,Joe Jacobson, Bob Lander —are working on a Centerfor Extreme Bionics.And the interesting thingof what you're seeing here isthese prostheticsnow get integrated into the bone.They get integrated into the skin.They get integrated into the muscle.And one of the other sides of Edis he's been thinkingabout how to connect the brainusing light or other mechanismsdirectly to things like these prosthetics.And if you can do that,then you can begin changingfundamental aspects of humanity.So how quickly you react to somethingdepends on the diameter of a nerve.And of course, if you have nervesthat are external or prosthetic,say with light or liquid metal,then you can increase that diameterand you could even increase ittheoretically to the point where,as long as you could see the muzzle flash,you could step out of the way of a bullet.Those are the order of magnitudeof changes you're talking about. This is a fourthsort of level of prosthetics.These are Phonak hearing aids,and the reasonwhy these are so interestingis because they cross the thresholdfrom where prosthetics are somethingfor somebody who is \"disabled\"and they become somethingthat somebody who is \"normal\"might want to actually have,because what this prosthetic does,which is really interesting,is not only does it help you hear,you can focus your hearing,so it can hear the conversationgoing on over there.You can have superhearing.You can have hearing in 360 degrees.You can have white noise.You can record, and oh, by the way,they also put a phone into this.So this functions as your hearing aidand also as your phone.And at that point, somebody might actuallywant to have a prosthetic voluntarily. All of these thousandsof loosely connected little piecesare coming together,and it's about time we ask the question,how do we want to evolve human beingsover the next century or two?And for that we turnto a great philosopherwho was a very smart mandespite being a Yankee fan. (Laughter) And Yogi Berra used to say, of course,that it's very tough to make predictions,especially about the future. (Laughter) So instead of making a predictionabout the future to begin with,let's take what's happening in the presentwith people like Tony Atala,who is redesigning 30-some-odd organs.And maybe the ultimate prostheticisn't having something external, titanium.Maybe the ultimate prostheticis take your own gene code,remake your own body parts,because that's a whole lot more effectivethan any kind of a prosthetic.But while you're at it, then you can takethe work of Craig Venter and Ham Smith.And one of the thingsthat we've been doingis trying to figure outhow to reprogram cells.And if you can reprogram a cell,then you can change the cellsin those organs.So if you can changethe cells in those organs,maybe you make those organsmore radiation-resistant.Maybe you make them absorb more oxygen.Maybe you make them more efficientto filter out stuffthat you don't want in your body. And over the last few weeks,George Church has been in the news a lotbecause he's been talking about takingone of these programmable cellsand inserting an entire human genomeinto that cell.And once you can insertan entire human genome into a cell,then you begin to ask the question,would you wantto enhance any of that genome?Do you want to enhance a human body?How would you wantto enhance a human body?Where is it ethicalto enhance a human bodyand where is it not ethicalto enhance a human body?And all of a sudden, what we're doingis we've got thismultidimensional chess boardwhere we can changehuman genetics by using virusesto attack things like AIDS,or we can change the gene codethrough gene therapyto do away with some hereditary diseases,or we can change the environment,and change the expressionof those genes in the epigenomeand pass that on to the next generations.And all of a sudden,it's not just one little bit,it's all these stacked little bitsthat allow youto take little portions of ituntil all the portions coming togetherlead you to somethingthat's very different. And a lot of peopleare very scared by this stuff.And it does sound scary,and there are risks to this stuff.So why in the world would youever want to do this stuff?Why would we really wantto alter the human bodyin a fundamental way? The answer lies in partwith Lord Rees,astronomer royal of Great Britain.And one of his favorite sayingsis the universe is 100 percent malevolent.So what does that mean?It means if you takeany one of your bodies at random,drop it anywhere in the universe,drop it in space, you die.Drop it on the Sun, you die.Drop it on the surfaceof Mercury, you die.Drop it near a supernova, you die.But fortunately, it's onlyabout 80 percent effective. So as a great physicist once said,there's these littleupstream eddies of biologythat create orderin this rapid torrent of entropy.So as the universe dissipates energy,there's these upstream eddiesthat create biological order.Now, the problem with eddies is,they tend to disappear.They shift. They move in rivers.And because of that, when an eddy shifts,when the Earth becomes a snowball,when the Earth becomes very hot,when the Earth gets hit by an asteroid,when you have supervolcanoes,when you have solar flares,when you have potentiallyextinction-level eventslike the next election —n(Laughter) then all of a sudden,you can have periodic extinctions.And by the way, that's happenedfive times on Earth,and therefore it is very likelythat the human species on Earthis going to go extinct someday.Not next week,not next month,maybe in November,but maybe 10,000 years after that.As you're thinkingof the consequence of that,if you believe that extinctionsare common and naturaland normal and occur periodically,it becomes a moral imperativeto diversify our species. And it becomes a moral imperativebecause it's going to bereally hard to live on Marsif we don't fundamentallymodify the human body.Right?You go from one cell,mom and dad coming togetherto make one cell,in a cascade to 10 trillion cells.We don't know, if you changethe gravity substantially,if the same thing will happento create your body.We do know that if you exposeour bodies as they currently areto a lot of radiation, we will die.So as you're thinking of that,you have to really redesign thingsjust to get to Mars.Forget about the moonsof Neptune or Jupiter. And to borrow from Nikolai Kardashev,let's think about lifein a series of scales.So Life One civilizationis a civilization that beginsto alter his or her looks.And we've been doing thatfor thousands of years.You've got tummy tucksand you've got this and you've got that.You alter your looks, and I'm toldthat not all of those alterationstake place for medical reasons. (Laughter) Seems odd. A Life Two civilizationis a different civilization.A Life Two civilization altersfundamental aspects of the body.So you put human growth hormone in,the person grows taller,or you put x in and the persongets fatter or loses metabolismor does a whole series of things,but you're altering the functionsin a fundamental way. To become an intrasolar civilization,we're going to have to createa Life Three civilization,and that looks very differentfrom what we've got here.Maybe you splice inDeinococcus radioduransso that the cells can respliceafter a lot of exposure to radiation.Maybe you breathe by having oxygenflow through your bloodinstead of through your lungs.But you're talking aboutreally radical redesigns,and one of the interesting thingsthat's happened in the last decadeis we've discovereda whole lot of planets out there.And some of them may be Earth-like.The problem is, if we everwant to get to these planets,the fastest human objects —Juno and Voyagerand the rest of this stuff —take tens of thousands of yearsto get from hereto the nearest solar system.So if you want to start exploringbeaches somewhere else,or you want to see two-sun sunsets,then you're talkingabout something that is very different,because you have to changethe timescale and the body of humansin ways which may beabsolutely unrecognizable.And that's a Life Four civilization. Now, we can't even beginto imagine what that might look like,but we're beginning to get glimpsesof instruments that mighttake us even that far.And let me give you two examples. So this is the wonderful Floyd Romesberg,and one of the thingsthat Floyd's been doingis he's been playingwith the basic chemistry of life.So all life on this planetis made in ATCGs, the four letters of DNA.All bacteria, all plants,all animals, all humans, all cows,everything else.And what Floyd did is he changed outtwo of those base pairs,so it's ATXY.And that means that you now havea parallel system to make life,to make babies, to reproduce, to evolve,that doesn't matewith most things on Earthor in fact maybe with nothing on Earth.Maybe you make plantsthat are immune to all bacteria.Maybe you make plantsthat are immune to all viruses.But why is that so interesting?It means that weare not a unique solution.It means you can createalternate chemistries to usthat could be chemistriesadaptable to a very different planetthat could create life and heredity. The second experiment,or the other implicationof this experiment,is that all of you, all lifeis based on 20 amino acids.If you don't substitute two amino acids,if you don't say ATXY,if you say ATCG + XY,then you go from20 building blocks to 172,and all of a sudden you've got172 building blocks of amino acidsto build life-formsin very different shapes. The second experiment to think aboutis a really weird experimentthat's been taking place in China.So this guy has been transplantinghundreds of mouse heads.Right?And why is that an interesting experiment?Well, think of the firstheart transplants.One of the things they used to dois they used to bring inthe wife or the daughter of the donorso the donee could tell the doctors,\"Do you recognize this person?Do you love this person?Do you feel anything for this person?\"We laugh about that today.We laugh because we knowthe heart is a muscle,but for hundreds of thousands of years,or tens of thousands of years,\"I gave her my heart.She took my heart. She broke my heart.\"We thought this was emotionand we thought maybe emotionswere transplanted with the heart. Nope. So how about the brain?Two possible outcomes to this experiment.If you can get a mousethat is functional,then you can see,is the new brain a blank slate?And boy, does that have implications.Second option:the new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse.The new mouseremembers what it's afraid of,remembers how to navigate the maze,and if that is true,then you can transplantmemory and consciousness.And then the reallyinteresting question is,if you can transplant this,is the only input-output mechanismthis down here?Or could you transplantthat consciousness into somethingthat would be very different,that would last in space,that would lasttens of thousands of years,that would be a completely redesigned bodythat could hold consciousnessfor a long, long period of time? And let's come back to the first question:Why would you ever want to do that?Well, I'll tell you why.Because this is the ultimate selfie. (Laughter) This is taken from six billion miles away,and that's Earth.And that's all of us.And if that little thing goes,all of humanity goes.And the reason you wantto alter the human bodyis because you eventuallywant a picture that says,that's us, and that's us,and that's us,because that's the way humanitysurvives long-term extinction.And that's the reason why it turns outit's actually unethicalnot to evolve the human bodyeven though it can be scary,even though it can be challenging,but it's what's goingto allow us to explore, liveand get to placeswe can't even dream of today,but which our great-great-great-great-grandchildren might someday. Thank you very much. (Applause) We can evolve bacteria, plants and animals — futurist Juan Enriquez asks: Is it ethical to evolve the human body? In a visionary talk that ranges from medieval prosthetics to present day neuroengineering and genetics, Enriquez sorts out the ethics associated with evolving humans and imagines the ways we'll have to transform our own bodies if we hope to explore and live in places other than Earth. Juan Enriquez thinks and writes about the profound changes that genomics and other life sciences will bring in business, technology, politics and society.

54	"For over a decade,I have studied young peoplethat have been pushed out of school,so called \"dropouts.\"As they end up failedby the education system,they're on the streetswhere they're vulnerable to violence,police harassment,police brutalityand incarceration.I follow these young peoplefor years at a time,across institutional settings,to try to understand what some of us callthe \"school-to-prison pipeline.\"nWhen you look at a picture like this,of young people who are in my study ...you might see trouble.I mean one of the boyshas a bottle of liquor in his hand,he's 14 years oldand it's a school day.Other people, when they see this picture,might see gangs,thugs, delinquents —criminals.But I see it different.I see these young peoplethrough a perspectivethat looks at the assetsthat they bring to the education system.So will you join me in changingthe way we label young peoplefrom \"at-risk\" to \"at-promise?\"n(Applause) How do I know that these young peoplehave the potentialand the promise to change?I know this because I am one of them.You see, I grew upin dire poverty in the inner city,without a father —he abandoned me before I was even born.We were on welfare,sometimes homeless,many times hungry.By the time I was 15 years old,I had been incarcerated in juvythree times for three felonies.My best friend had already been killed.And soon after,while I'm standing next to my uncle,he gets shot.And as I'm waitingfor the ambulance to arrivefor over an hour ...he bleeds to death on the street.I had lost faith and hope in the world,and I had given up on the systembecause the system had failed me.I had nothing to offerand no one had anything to offer me.I was fatalistic.I didn't even thinkI could make it to my 18th birthday. The reason I'm here todayis because a teacherthat cared reached outand managed to tap into my soul.This teacher,Ms. Russ ...she was the kind of teacherthat was always in your business. (Laughter) She was the kind of teacher that was like,\"Victor, I'm here for youwhenever you're ready.\"n(Laughter) I wasn't ready.But she understood one basic principleabout young people like me.We're like oysters.We're only going to open upwhen we're ready,and if you're not there when we're ready,we're going to clam back up.Ms. Russ was there for me.She was culturally relevant,she respected my community,my people, my family.I told her a story about my Uncle Ruben.He would take me to work with himbecause I was broke,and he knew I needed some money.He collected glass bottles for a living.Four in the morning on a school day,we'd throw the glass bottlesin the back of his van,and the bottles would break.And my hands and arms would start to bleedand my tennis shoes and pantswould get all bloody.And I was terrified and in pain,and I would stop working.And my uncle, he would look me in the eyesand he would say to me,\"Mijo,estamos buscando vida.\"\"We're searching for a better life,we're trying to makesomething out of nothing.\"nMs. Russ listened to my story,welcomed it into the classroom and said,\"Victor, this is your power.This is your potential.Your family, your culture, your communityhave taught you a hard-work ethicand you will use it to empoweryourself in the academic worldso you can come backand empower your community.\"nWith Ms. Russ's help,I ended up returning to school.I even finished my credits on timeand graduated with my class. (Applause) But Ms. Russ said to meright before graduation,\"Victor, I'm so proud of you.I knew you could do it.Now it's time to go to college.\"n(Laughter) College, me?Man, what is this teacher smokingthinking I'm going to college?I applied with the mentorsand support she provided,got a letter of acceptance,and one of the paragraphs read,\"You've been admittedunder probationary status.\"I said, \"Probation?I'm already on probation,that don't matter?\"n(Laughter) It was academic probation,not criminal probation.But what do teachers like Ms. Russdo to succeed with young peoplelike the ones I study?I propose three strategies.The first:let's get rid of ourdeficit perspective in education.\"These peoplecome from a culture of violence,a culture of poverty.These people are at-risk;these people are truant.These people are empty containersfor us to fill with knowledge.They have the problems,we have the solutions.\"Number two.Let's value the stories that young peoplebring to the schoolhouse.Their stories of overcominginsurmountable odds are so powerful.And I know you know some of these stories.These very same stories and experiencesalready have grit, characterand resilience in them.So let's help young peoplerefine those stories.Let's help them be proud of who they are,because our education systemwelcomes their families, their cultures,their communitiesand the skill setthey've learned to survive.And of course the third strategybeing the most important:resources.We have to provideadequate resources to young people.Grit alone isn't going to cut it.You can sit thereand tell me all you want,\"Hey man, pick yourself upby the bootstraps.\"But if I was bornwithout any straps on my boots —n(Laughter) How am I supposed to pick myself up? (Applause) Job training,mentoring,counseling ...Teaching young peopleto learn from their mistakesinstead of criminalizing them,and dragging them outof their classrooms like animals.How about this?I propose that we implement restorativejustice in every high school in America. (Applause) So we went out to test these ideasin the community of Watts in LAwith 40 young peoplethat had been pushed out of school.William was one of them.William was the kind of kidthat had been given every label.He had dropped out, he was a gang member,a criminal.And when we met him he was very resistant.But I remember what Ms. Russ used to say.\"Hey, I'm here for youwhenever you're ready.\"n(Laughter) So over time —over time he began to open up.And I remember the daythat he made the switch.We were in a large groupand a young lady in our program was cryingbecause she told us her powerful storyof her dad being killedand then his body being shownin the newspaper the next day.And as she's crying,I don't know what to do,so I give her her space,and William had enough.He slammed his handson the desk and he said,\"Hey, everybody! Group hug! Group hug!\"n(Applause) This young lady's tears and painturned into joy and laughterknowing that her community had her back,and William had now learnedthat he did have a purpose in life:to help to heal the soulsof people in his own community.He told us his story.We refined his storyto go from being the story of a victimto being the story of a survivorthat has overcome adversity.We placed high value on it.William went on to finish high school,get his security guard certificateto become a security guard,and is now workingat a local school district. (Applause) Ms. Russ's mantra —her mantra was always,\"when you teach to the heart,the mind will follow.\"The great writer Khalil Gibran says,\"Out of sufferinghave emerged the greatest souls.The massive charactersare seared with scars.\"I believe that in this educationrevolution that we're talking aboutwe need to invite the soulsof the young people that we work with,and once they're able to refine —identify their grit,resilience and characterthat they've already developed —their academic performance will improve. Let's believe in young people.Let's provide themthe right kinds of resources.I'll tell you what my teacher did for me.She believed in me so muchthat she tricked meinto believing in myself. Thank you. (Applause) Define students by what they contribute, not what they lack — especially those with difficult upbringings, says educator Victor Rios. Interweaved with his personal tale of perseverance as an inner-city youth, Rios identifies three straightforward strategies to shift attitudes in education and calls for fellow educators to see \"at-risk\" students as \"at-promise\" individuals brimming with resilience, character and grit. Victor Rios seeks to uncover how to best support the lives of young people who experience poverty, stigma and social exclusion.

56	"Economists have been exploringpeople's behavior for hundreds of years:how we make decisions,how we act individually and in groups,how we exchange value.They've studied the institutionsthat facilitate our trade,like legal systems,corporations,marketplaces.But there is a new,technological institutionthat will fundamentally changehow we exchange value,and it's called the blockchain. Now, that's a pretty bold statement,but if you take nothing elseaway from this talk,I actually want you to rememberthat while blockchain technologyis relatively new,it's also a continuationof a very human story,and the story is this.As humans, we find waysto lower uncertainty about one anotherso that we can exchange value. Now, one of the first peopleto really explore the ideaof institutions as a tool in economicsto lower our uncertaintiesabout one anotherand be able to do tradewas the Nobel economist Douglass North.He passed away at the end of 2015,but North pioneered what's called\"new institutional economics.\"And what he meant by institutionswere really just formal ruleslike a constitution,and informal constraints, like bribery.These institutions are really the greasethat allow our economicwheels to function,and we can see this play outover the course of human history. If we think back to when we werehunter-gatherer economies,we really just tradedwithin our village structure.We had some informal constraints in place,but we enforcedall of our trade with violenceor social repercussions.As our societies grew more complexand our trade routes grew more distant,we built up more formal institutions,institutions like banks for currency,governments, corporations.These institutionshelped us manage our tradeas the uncertaintyand the complexity grew,and our personal control was much lower.Eventually with the internet,we put these same institutions online.We built platform marketplaceslike Amazon, eBay, Alibaba,just faster institutionsthat act as middlemento facilitate human economic activity. As Douglass North saw it,institutions are a toolto lower uncertaintyso that we can connect and exchangeall kinds of value in society.And I believe we are now enteringa further and radical evolutionof how we interact and trade,because for the first time,we can lower uncertaintynot just with politicaland economic institutions,like our banks, our corporations,our governments,but we can do it with technology alone. So what is the blockchain?Blockchain technologyis a decentralized databasethat stores a registryof assets and transactionsacross a peer-to-peer network.It's basically a public registryof who owns what and who transacts what.The transactions are securedthrough cryptography,and over time, that transaction historygets locked in blocks of datathat are then cryptographicallylinked together and secured.This creates an immutable,unforgeable recordof all of the transactionsacross this network.This record is replicatedon every computer that uses the network. It's not an app.It's not a company.I think it's closest in descriptionto something like Wikipedia.We can see everything on Wikipedia.It's a composite view that's constantlychanging and being updated.We can also track those changesover time on Wikipedia,and we can create our own wikis,because at their core,they're just a data infrastructure.On Wikipedia, it's an open platformthat stores words and imagesand the changes to that data over time.On the blockchain,you can think of itas an open infrastructurethat stores many kinds of assets.It stores the history of custodianship,ownership and locationfor assets likethe digital currency Bitcoin,other digital assetslike a title of ownership of IP.It could be a certificate, a contract,real world objects,even personal identifiable information.There are of course othertechnical details to the blockchain,but at its core, that's how it works.It's this public registrythat stores transactions in a networkand is replicated so that it's very secureand hard to tamper with. Which brings me to my pointof how blockchains lower uncertaintyand how they therefore promiseto transform our economic systemsin radical ways.So uncertainty is kind of a big termin economics,but I want to go through three forms of itthat we face in almost allof our everyday transactions,where blockchains can play a role.We face uncertaintieslike not knowing who we're dealing with,not having visibility into a transactionand not having recourseif things go wrong. So let's take the first example,not knowing who we're dealing with.Say I want to buya used smartphone on eBay.The first thing I'm going to dois look up who I'm buying from.Are they a power user?Do they have great reviews and ratings,or do they have no profile at all?Reviews, ratings, checkmarks:these are the attestationsabout our identitiesthat we cobble together todayand use to lower uncertaintyabout who we're dealing with.But the problem isthey're very fragmented.Think about how many profiles you have.Blockchains allow for usto create an open, global platformon which to store any attestationabout any individualfrom any source.This allows us to create a user-controlledportable identity.More than a profile,it means you can selectively revealthe different attributes about youthat help facilitate trade or interaction,for instance that a governmentissued you an ID,or that you're over 21,by revealing the cryptographic proofthat these details existand are signed off on.Having this kind of portable identityaround the physical worldand the digital worldmeans we can do all kinds of human tradein a totally new way. So I've talked about how blockchainscould lower uncertaintyin who we're dealing with.The second uncertainty that we often faceis just not having transparencyinto our interactions.Say you're going to send methat smartphone by mail.I want some degree of transparency.I want to know that the product I boughtis the same one that arrives in the mailand that there's some recordfor how it got to me.This is true not justfor electronics like smartphones,but for many kinds of goods and data,things like medicine, luxury goods,any kind of data or productthat we don't want tampered with. The problem in many companies,especially those that producesomething complicated like a smartphone,is they're managingall of these different vendorsacross a horizontal supply chain.All of these peoplethat go into making a product,they don't have the same database.They don't use the same infrastructure,and so it becomes really hard to seetransparently a product evolve over time. Using the blockchain, we can createa shared realityacross nontrusting entities.By this I meanall of these nodes in the networkdo not need to know each otheror trust each other,because they each have the abilityto monitor and validatethe chain for themselves.Think back to Wikipedia.It's a shared database,and even though it has multiple readersand multiple writers at the same time,it has one single truth.So we can create that using blockchains.We can create a decentralized databasethat has the same efficiency of a monopolywithout actually creatingthat central authority.So all of these vendors,all sorts of companies,can interact using the same databasewithout trusting one another.It means for consumers,we can have a lot more transparency.As a real-world object travels along,we can see its digital certificateor token move on the blockchain,adding value as it goes.This is a whole new worldin terms of our visibility. So I've talked about how blockchainscan lower our uncertainties about identityand how they changewhat we mean about transparencyin long distances and complex trades,like in a supply chain.The last uncertainty that we often faceis one of the most open-ended,and it's reneging.What if you don't send me the smartphone?Can I get my money back?Blockchains allow us to write code,binding contracts,between individualsand then guaranteethat those contracts will bear outwithout a third party enforcer.So if we look at the smartphone example,you could think about escrow.You are financing that phone,but you don't need to release the fundsuntil you can verifythat all the conditions have been met.You got the phone. I think this is oneof the most exciting waysthat blockchains lower our uncertainties,because it means to some degreewe can collapse institutionsand their enforcement.It means a lot of human economic activitycan get collateralized and automated,and push a lot of humanintervention to the edges,the places where information movesfrom the real world to the blockchain. I think what would probablyfloor Douglass Northabout this use of technologyis the fact that the very thingthat makes it work,the very thing that keeps the blockchainsecure and verified,is our mutual distrust.So rather than all of our uncertaintiesslowing us downand requiring institutionslike banks, our governments,our corporations,we can actually harnessall of that collective uncertaintyand use it to collaborate and exchangemore and faster and more open. Now, I don't want youto get the impressionthat the blockchainis the solution to everything,even though the media has saidthat it's going to end world poverty,it's also going to solvethe counterfeit drug problemand potentially save the rainforest.The truth is, this technologyis in its infancy,and we're going to need to seea lot of experiments take placeand probably failbefore we truly understandall of the use casesfor our economy.But there are tons of peopleworking on this,from financial institutionsto technology companies,start-ups and universities.And one of the reasons isthat it's not just an economic evolution.It's also an innovationin computer science. Blockchains give usthe technological capabilityof creating a record of human exchange,of exchange of currency,of all kinds of digitaland physical assets,even of our own personal attributes,in a totally new way.So in some ways,they become a technological institutionthat has a lot of the benefitsof the traditional institutionswe're used to using in society,but it does this in a decentralized way.It does this by convertinga lot of our uncertaintiesinto certainties. So I think we need to startpreparing ourselves,because we are about to face a worldwhere distributed, autonomous institutionshave quite a significant role. Thank you. (Applause) Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.I think I understood that it's coming,it offers a lot of potential,and it's complex.What is your estimatefor the rate of adoption? Bettina Warburg: I thinkthat's a really good question.My lab is pretty much focusedon going the enterpriseand government route first,because in reality,blockchain is a complex technology.How many of you actually understandhow the internet works?But you use it every day,so I think we're sort of facingthe same John Sculley ideaof technology should either beinvisible or beautiful,and blockchain is kind ofneither of those things right now,so it's better suitedfor either really early adopterswho kind of get it and can tinker aroundor for finding those best use caseslike identity or asset trackingor smart contractsthat can be used at that levelof an enterprise or government. BG: Thank you. Thanks for coming to TED. BW: Thanks. (Applause) Say hello to the decentralized economy — the blockchain is about to change everything. In this lucid explainer of the complex (and confusing) technology, Bettina Warburg describes how the blockchain will eliminate the need for centralized institutions like banks or governments to facilitate trade, evolving age-old models of commerce and finance into something far more interesting: a distributed, transparent, autonomous system for exchanging value.

57	"I design engineering projectsfor middle schooland high school students,often using materialsthat are pretty unexpected.My inspiration comesfrom problems in my daily life.For example,one time I needed a costumeto go to a comic convention,but I didn't want to spend too much money,so I made my own ...with a light-up crown and skirt. (Laughter) Another time,I was devastatedbecause my favorite mobile game,Flappy Bird,was being taken off the app store. (Laughter) So I was faced with the dilemmato either never update my phoneor never play Flappy Bird again. (Laughter) Unhappy with both options,I did the only thingthat made sense to me.I made a physical version of Flappy Birdthat could never betaken off the app store. (Laughter) (Music) (Beeping) (Music) (Laughter) So a few of my friendswere also pretty addicted to the game,and I invited them to play as well. (Video) Friend: Ah!n(Laughter) (Video) Friend: What the heck? (Laughter) And they told me that it wasjust as infuriating as the original game. (Laughter) So I uploaded a demoof this project online,and to my surprise it went viral.It had over two million viewsin just a few days. (Laughter) And what's more interestingare people's comments.A lot of peoplewanted to make it their own,or asked me how it was made.So this kind of confirmed my ideathat through a creative project,we can teach people about engineering. With the money made from the viral video,we were able to let studentsin our classroomall make their own game in a box.Although it was pretty challenging,they learned a lot of new conceptsin engineering and programming.And they were all eager to learnso they could finish the game as well. (Laughter) So before Flappy Bird Box,I had the idea of using creativeengineering projects to teach students.When I was teaching at a middle school,we asked our students to build a robotfrom a standard technology kit.And I noticed thata lot of them seemed bored.Then a few of themstarted taking pieces of paperand decorating their robots.And then more of them got into it,and they becamemore interested in the project.So I started lookingfor more creative waysto introduce technology to students.What I found was that most technology kitsavailable in schoollook a little intimidating.They're all made of plastic partsthat you can't customize.On top of that,they're all very expensive,costing hundreds of dollars per kit.So that's certainly not very affordablefor most classroom budgets. Since I didn't find anything,I decided to make something on my own.I started with paper and fabric.After all, we all playedwith those since we were kids,and they are also pretty cheapand can be foundanywhere around the house.And I prototyped a projectwhere studentscan create a light-up creatureusing fabric and googly eyes.They were all helpingeach other in classrooms,and were laughingand discussing the project.And most importantly,they were able to inserttheir own creativity into the project. So because of the success of this project,I continued to createmore engineering projectsto challenge my students.And I also started to takethese workshops outside of schooland into the community.And something really interesting happened.I noticed a lot of peoplefrom very diverse backgroundsstarted coming to our workshops.And specifically,there were a lot more womenand minorities than I expected,and that you wouldn't usually seeat a traditional engineering workshop. Now take a look at this employee reportat a major technology company in 2016.Women make up only 19 percentof the technology workforce.And underrepresented minoritiesmake up only four percent.This statistic might look familiarif you walked intoa high school robotics club,or a college engineering class. Now, there's a wide variety of problemsthat contribute to the lack of diversityin the technology force.Perhaps one solution could beto introduce technology to studentsthrough creative projects.I'm not saying that thiscould solve everything,but it could introduce technologyto people who originallywouldn't be interested in itbecause of how it has beenportrayed and taught in school. So how do we start to changethe perception of technology?Most students thinkthat it's boring or unwelcoming,so I have always designed projectsfollowing three principles.First is having a low floor,and that means this projectis easy to get started.So take a look at this tutorial.The first projectwe asked students to learnis to make a circuit on paper.As you can see, it doesn'ttake very long to learn,and it's pretty easy even for beginners.And having a low floor also meansthat we're removing the financial barrierthat prevents peoplefrom completing a project.So with paper, copper tape,lightbulb and a battery,people can complete this projectfor under a dollar. So second principleis having a high ceiling.This means that there'sa lot of room to grow,and students areconstantly being challenged.At first it might just bea light-up creature,but then you can add sensorsand microcontrollers,and start to program the creatureto interact with its environment. (Laughter) And finally,the third principle is customization.This means that we can makethis project relevant to anyone.That's the beautyof using everyday materials;it's very easy to customizeusing paper and fabric.So even if you don't like Flappy Bird,you can still make your own game. (Video) Student: So our gameis about Justin Bieber,because he's been speeding,and the object is to prevent himfrom getting caught by the LAPD —n(Laughter) (Video) Student:Yeah, but he's changing so —we're a part of his posse. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) TED Resident Fawn Qiu designs fun, low-cost projects that use familiar materials like paper and fabric to introduce engineering to kids.

58	"Half of the human workforceis expected to be replacedby software and robotsin the next 20 years.And many corporate leaders welcomethat as a chance to increase profits.Machines are more efficient;humans are complicatedand difficult to manage. Well, I want our organizationsto remain human.In fact, I want them to become beautiful.Because as machines take our jobsand do them more efficiently,soon the only work left for us humanswill be the kind of workthat must be done beautifullyrather than efficiently. To maintain our humanityin the this second Machine Age,we may have no other choicethan to create beauty.Beauty is an elusive concept.For the writer Stendhalit was the promise of happiness.For me it's a goal by Lionel Messi. (Laughter) So bear with meas I am proposing four admittedlyvery subjective principlesthat you can use to builda beautiful organization. First: do the unnecessary. [Do the Unnecessary]nA few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya,the CEO and founderof the yogurt company Chobani,made headlines when he decided to grantstock to all of his 2,000 employees.Some called it a PR stunt,others — a genuine act of giving back.But there is something elsethat was remarkable about it.It came completely out of the blue.There had been no marketor stakeholder pressure,and employees were so surprisedthat they burst into tearswhen they heard the news.Actions like Ulukaya's are beautifulbecause they catch us off guard.They create something out of nothingbecause they're completely unnecessary. I once worked at a companythat was the result of a mergerof a large IT outsourcing firmand a small design firm.We were merging 9,000 software engineerswith 1,000 creative types.And to unify theseimmensely different cultures,we were going to launcha third, new brand.And the new brand colorwas going to be orange.And as we were goingthrough the budget for the rollouts,we decided last minuteto cut the purchaseof 10,000 orange balloons,which we had meantto distribute to all staff worldwide.They just seemedunnecessary and cute in the end.I didn't know back thenthat our decisionmarked the beginning of the end —that these two organizationswould never become one.And sure enough,the merger eventually failed.Now, was it becausethere weren't any orange balloons?No, of course not.But the kill-the-orange-balloonsmentality permeated everything else.You might not always realize it,but when you cut the unnecessary,you cut everything.Leading with beauty meansrising above what is merely necessary.So do not kill your orange balloons. The second principle:create intimacy. [Create Intimacy]nStudies show thathow we feel about our workplacevery much depends on the relationshipswith our coworkers.And what are relationshipsother than a string of microinteractions?There are hundreds of theseevery day in our organizationsthat have the potential to distinguisha good life from a beautiful one.The marriage researcher John Gottman saysthat the secret of a healthy relationshipis not the great gestureor the lofty promise,it's small moments of attachment.In other words, intimacy.In our networked organizations,we tout the strength of weak tiesbut we underestimatethe strength of strong ones.We forget the words of the writerRichard Bach who once said,\"Intimacy —not connectedness —intimacy is the opposite of loneliness.\"nSo how do we designfor organizational intimacy?The humanitarian organization CAREwanted to launcha campaign on gender equalityin villages in northern India.But it realized quicklythat it had to have this conversationfirst with its own staff.So it invited all 36 team membersand their partnersto one of the Khajuraho Temples,known for their famous erotic sculptures.And there they openly discussedtheir personal relationships —their own experiences of gender equalitywith the coworkers and the partners.It was eye-opening for the participants.Not only did it allow themto relate to the communities they serve,it also broke down invisible barriersand created a lasting bondamongst themselves.Not a single team memberquit in the next four years.So this is how you create intimacy.No masks ...or lots of masks. (Laughter) When Danone, the food company,wanted to translate its new companymanifesto into product initiatives,it gathered the management teamand 100 employeesfrom across different departments,seniority levels and regionsfor a three-day strategy retreat.And it asked everybodyto wear costumes for the entire meeting:wigs, crazy hats, feather boas,huge glasses and so on.And they left with concrete outcomesand full of enthusiasm.And when I asked the womanwho had designed this experiencewhy it worked,she simply said, \"Never underestimatethe power of a ridiculous wig.\"n(Laughter) (Applause) Because wigs erase hierarchy,and hierarchy kills intimacy —both ways,for the CEO and the intern.Wigs allow us to usethe disguise of the falseto show something true about ourselves.And that's not easyin our everyday work lives,because the relationshipwith our organizationsis often like that of a married couplethat has grown apart,suffered betrayals and disappointments,and is now desperate to be beautifulfor one another once again.And for either of us the first steptowards beauty involves a huge risk.The risk to be ugly. [Be Ugly]nSo many organizations these daysare keen on designing beautiful workplacesthat look like anything but work:vacation resorts, coffee shops,playgrounds or college campuses —n(Laughter) Based on the promisesof positive psychology,we speak of play and gamification,and one start-up even saysthat when someone gets fired,they have graduated. (Laughter) That kind of beautiful languageonly goes \"skin deep,but ugly cuts clean to the bone,\"as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.To be authentic is to be ugly.It doesn't mean that you can't have funor must give in to the vulgar or cynical,but it does mean that you speakthe actual ugly truth.Like this manufacturerthat wanted to transformone of its struggling business units.It identified, named and pinnedon large boards all the issues —and there were hundreds of them —that had become obstaclesto better performance.They put them on boards,moved them all into one room,which they called \"the ugly room.\"The ugly became visiblefor everyone to see —it was celebrated.And the ugly room served as a mixof mirror exhibition and operating room —a biopsy on the living fleshto cut out all the bureaucracy. The ugliest part of our body is our brain.Literally and neurologically.Our brain renders uglywhat is unfamiliar ...modern art, atonal music,jazz, maybe —VR goggles for that matter —strange objects, sounds and people.But we've all been ugly once.We were a weird-looking baby,a new kid on the block, a foreigner.And we will be ugly againwhen we don't belong. The Center for Political Beauty,an activist collective in Berlin,recently staged an extremeartistic intervention.With the permission of relatives,it exhumed the corpses of refugeeswho had drowned at Europe's borders,transported them all the way to Berlin,and then reburied themat the heart of the German capital.The idea was to allow themto reach their desired destination,if only after their death.Such acts of beautificationmay not be pretty,but they are much needed.Because things tend to get uglywhen there's only one meaning, one truth,only answers and no questions.Beautiful organizationskeep asking questions.They remain incomplete,which is the fourthand the last of the principles. [Remain Incomplete]nRecently I was in Paris,and a friend of minetook me to Nuit Debout,which stands for \"up all night,\"the self-organized protest movementthat had formed in responseto the proposed labor laws in France.Every night, hundreds gatheredat the Place de la République.Every night they set upa small, temporary villageto deliberate their own visionof the French Republic.And at the core of this adhocracywas a general assemblywhere anybody could speakusing a specially designed sign language.Like Occupy Wall Streetand other protest movements,Nuit Debout was bornin the face of crisis.It was messy —full of controversies and contradictions.But whether you agreedwith the movement's goals or not,every gathering wasa beautiful lesson in raw humanity.And how fitting that Paris —the city of ideals, the city of beauty —was it's stage.It reminds us that like great cities,the most beautiful organizationsare ideas worth fighting for —even and especiallywhen their outcome is uncertain.They are movements;they are always imperfect,never fully organized,so they avoid ever becoming banal.They have somethingbut we don't know what it is.They remain mysterious;we can't take our eyes off them.We find them beautiful. So to do the unnecessary,to create intimacy,to be ugly,to remain incomplete —these are not only the qualitiesof beautiful organizations,these are inherentlyhuman characteristics.And these are also the qualitiesof what we call home.And as we disrupt, and are disrupted,the least we can do is to ensurethat we still feel at homein our organizations,and that we use our organizationsto create that feeling for others. Beauty can save the worldwhen we embrace these principlesand design for them.In the face of artificial intelligenceand machine learning,we need a new radical humanism.We must acquire and promotea new aesthetic and sentimental education.Because if we don't,we might end up feeling like aliensin organizations and societiesthat are full of smart machinesthat have no appreciation whatsoeverfor the unnecessary,the intimate,the incompleteand definitely not for the ugly. Thank you. (Applause) In the face of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we need a new radical humanism, says Tim Leberecht. For the self-described \"business romantic,\" this means designing organizations and workplaces that celebrate authenticity instead of efficiency and questions instead of answers. Leberecht proposes four (admittedly subjective) principles for building beautiful organizations. A humanist in Silicon Valley, Tim Leberecht argues that in a time of artificial intelligence, big data and the quantification of everything, we are losing sight of the importance of the emotional and social aspects of our work.

60	"Please meet Jane.She has a high-risk pregnancy.Within 24 weeks,she's on bed rest at the hospital,being monitoredfor her preterm contractions. She doesn't look the happiest.That's in part because it requirestechnicians and expertsto apply these clunky belts on herto monitor her uterine contractions.Another reason Jane is not so happyis because she's worried.In particular, she's worriedabout what happensafter her 10-day stayon bed rest at the hospital.What happens when she's home?If she were to give birth this earlyit would be devastating.As an African-American woman,she's twice as likelyto have a premature birthor to have a stillbirth.So Jane basically has one of two options:stay at the hospital on bed rest,a prisoner to the technologyuntil she gives birth,and then spend the restof her life paying for the bill;or head home after her 10-day stayand hope for the best.Neither of these two optionsseems appealing. As I began to thinkabout stories like thisand hear about stories like this,I began to ask myself and imagine:Is there an alternative?Is there a way we could havethe benefits of high-fidelity monitoringthat we get with our trustedpartners in the hospitalwhile someone is at homeliving their daily life? With that in mind,I encouraged people in my research groupto partner with someclever material scientists,and all of us came togetherand brainstormed.And after a long process,we came up with a vision, an idea,of a wearable system that perhapsyou could wear like a piece of jewelryor you could applyto yourself like a Band-Aid.And after many trials and tribulationsand years of endeavors,we were able to come upwith this flexible electronic patchthat was manufacturedusing the same processesthat they use to build computer chips,except the electronics are transferredfrom a semiconductor waferonto a flexible materialthat can interface with the human body. These systems are aboutthe thickness of a human hair.They can measure the typesof information that we want,things such as:bodily movement,bodily temperature,electrical rhythms of the bodyand so forth.We can also engineer these systems,so they can integrate energy sources,and can have wirelesstransmission capabilities. So as we began to buildthese types of systems,we began to test them on ourselvesin our research group.But in addition, we began to reach outto some of our clinical partnersin San Diego,and test these on different patientsin different clinical conditions,including moms-to-be like Jane. Here is a picture of a pregnant womanin labor at our university hospitalbeing monitored for her uterinecontractions with the conventional belt.In addition,our flexible electronic patches are there.This picture demonstrates waveformspertaining to the fetal heart rate,where the red correspondsto what was acquiredwith the conventional belts,and the blue corresponds to our estimatesusing our flexible electronic systemsand our algorithms. At this moment,we gave ourselves a big mental high five.Some of the things we had imaginedwere beginning to come to fruition,and we were actually seeing thisin a clinical context. But there was still a problem.The problem was, the waywe manufactured these systemswas very inefficient,had low yieldand was very error-prone.In addition,as we talked to someof the nurses in the hospital,they encouraged us to make surethat our electronics workedwith typical medical adhesivesthat are used in a hospital.We had an epiphany and said,\"Wait a minute.Rather than just makingthem work with adhesives,let's integrate them into adhesives,and that could solveour manufacturing problem.\"nThis picture that you see hereis our ability to embed these censorsinside of a piece of Scotch tapeby simply peeling it off of a wafer.Ongoing work in our research groupallows us to, in addition,embed integrated circuitsinto the flexible adhesivesto do things like amplifying signalsand digitizing them,processing themand encoding for wireless transmission.All of this integratedinto the same medical adhesivesthat are used in the hospital. So when we reached this point,we had some other challenges,from both an engineeringas well as a usability perspective,to make sure that we couldmake it used practically. In many digital health discussions,people believe in and embrace the ideathat we can simply digitize the data,wirelessly transmit it,send it to the cloud,and in the cloud,we can extract meaningfulinformation for interpretation.And indeed, you can do all of that,if you're not worriedabout some of the energy challenges.Think about Jane for a moment.She doesn't live in Palo Alto,nor does she live in Beverly Hills.What that means is,we have to be mindful about her data planand how much it would costfor her to be sending outa continuous stream of data. There's another challengethat not everyone in the medicalprofession is comfortable talking about.And that is, that Janedoes not have the most trustin the medical establishment.She, people like her, her ancestors,have not had the best experiencesat the hands of doctors and the hospitalor insurance companies.That means that we have to be mindfulof questions of privacy.Jane might not feel that happyabout all that databeing processed into the cloud.And Jane cannot be fooled;she reads the news.She knows that if the federalgovernment can be hacked,if the Fortune 500 can be hacked,so can her doctor. And so with that in mind,we had an epiphany.We cannot outsmartall the hackers in the world,but perhaps we can presentthem a smaller target.What if we could actually,rather than have those algorithmsthat do data interpretationrun in the cloud,what if we have those algorithms runon those small integrated circuitsembedded into those adhesives? And so when we integratethese things together,what this means is that nowwe can think about the futurewhere someone like Jane can stillgo about living her normal daily life,she can be monitored,it can be done in a way whereshe doesn't have to get another jobto pay her data plan,and we can also addresssome of her concerns about privacy. So at this point,we're feeling very good about ourselves.We've accomplished this,we've begun to address someof these questions about privacyand we feel like, pretty muchthe chapter is closed now.Everyone lived happily ever after, right?Well, not so fast. (Laughter) One of the things we have to remember,as I mentioned earlier,is that Jane does not have the most trustin the medical establishment.We have to rememberthat there are increasingand widening health disparities,and there's inequity in termsof proper care management.And so what that meansis that this simple pictureof Jane and her data —even with her being comfortablebeing wirelessly transmitted to the cloud,letting a doctor intervene if necessary —is not the whole story. So what we're beginning to dois to think about ways to havetrusted parties serve as intermediariesbetween people like Janeand her health care providers.For example, we've begunto partner with churchesand to think about nursesthat are church members,that come from that trusted community,as patient advocates and health coachesto people like Jane. Another thing we have going for usis that insurance companies, increasingly,are attracted to some of these ideas.They're increasingly realizingthat perhaps it's betterto pay one dollar nowfor a wearable device and a health coach,rather than paying 10 dollars later,when that baby is born prematurelyand ends up in the neonatalintensive care unit —one of the most expensiveparts of a hospital. This has been a longlearning process for us.This iterative process of breakingthrough and attacking one problemand not feeling totally comfortable,and identifying the next problem,has helped us go along this pathof actually trying to not onlyinnovate with this technologybut make sure it can be used for peoplewho perhaps need it the most. Another learning lessonwe've taken from this processthat is very humbling,is that as technology progressesand advances at an accelerating rate,we have to remember that human beingsare using this technology,and we have to be mindfulthat these human beings —they have a face,they have a nameand a life.And in the case of Jane,hopefully, two. Thank you. (Applause) What if doctors could monitor patients at home with the same degree of accuracy they'd get during a stay at the hospital?

61	"Let's talk about trust.We all know trust is fundamental,but when it comes to trusting people,something profound is happening. Please raise your handif you have ever beena host or a guest on Airbnb.Wow. That's a lot of you. Who owns Bitcoin?Still a lot of you. OK. And please raise your handif you've ever used Tinderto help you find a mate. (Laughter) This one's really hard to countbecause you're kind of going like this. (Laughter) These are all examples of how technologyis creating new mechanismsthat are enabling us to trustunknown people, companies and ideas.And yet at the same time,trust in institutions —banks, governments and even churches —is collapsing.So what's happening here,and who do you trust? Let's start in France with a platform —with a company, I should say —with a rather funny-sounding name,BlaBlaCar.It's a platform that matchesdrivers and passengerswho want to sharelong-distance journeys together.The average ride taken is 320 kilometers.So it's a good ideato choose your fellow travelers wisely.Social profiles and reviewshelp people make a choice.You can see if someone's a smoker,you can see what kind of music they like,you can see if they're going to bringtheir dog along for the ride.But it turns outthat the key social identifieris how much you're goingto talk in the car. (Laughter) Bla, not a lot,bla bla, you want a nice bit of chitchat,and bla bla bla, you're not goingto stop talking the entire wayfrom London to Paris. (Laughter) It's remarkable, right,that this idea works at all,because it's counter to the lessonmost of us were taught as a child:never get in a car with a stranger.And yet, BlaBlaCar transportsmore than four million peopleevery single month.To put that in context,that's more passengersthan the Eurostaror JetBlue airlines carry.BlaBlaCar is a beautiful illustrationof how technology is enablingmillions of people across the worldto take a trust leap. A trust leap happens when we take the riskto do something new or differentto the way that we've always done it.Let's try to visualize this together.OK. I want you to close your eyes.There is a man staring at mewith his eyes wide open.I'm on this big red circle. I can see.So close your eyes. (Laughter) (Applause) I'll do it with you.And I want you to imaginethere exists a gapbetween you and something unknown.That unknown can besomeone you've just met.It can be a place you've never been to.It can be somethingyou've never tried before.You got it?OK. You can open your eyes now.For you to leap from a place of certainty,to take a chance on that someoneor something unknown,you need a force to pull you over the gap,and that remarkable force is trust. Trust is an elusive concept,and yet we depend on itfor our lives to function.I trust my childrenwhen they say they're goingto turn the lights out at night.I trusted the pilotwho flew me here to keep me safe.It's a word we use a lot,without always thinkingabout what it really meansand how it works in differentcontexts of our lives. There are, in fact,hundreds of definitions of trust,and most can be reducedto some kind of risk assessmentof how likely it isthat things will go right.But I don't like this definition of trust,because it makes trustsound rational and predictable,and it doesn't really getto the human essenceof what it enables us to doand how it empowers usto connect with other people. So I define trust a little differently.I define trust as a confidentrelationship to the unknown.Now, when you view trustthrough this lens,it starts to explainwhy it has the unique capacityto enable us to cope with uncertainty,to place our faith in strangers,to keep moving forward. Human beings are remarkableat taking trust leaps.Do you remember the first timeyou put your credit card detailsinto a website?That's a trust leap.I distinctly remember telling my dadthat I wanted to buy a navy bluesecondhand Peugeot on eBay,and he rightfully pointed outthat the seller's namewas \"Invisible Wizard\"and that this probablywas not such a good idea. (Laughter) So my work, my researchfocuses on how technologyis transformingthe social glue of society,trust between people,and it's a fascinating area to study,because there's stillso much we do not know.For instance, do men and womentrust differently in digital environments?Does the way we build trustface-to-face translate online?Does trust transfer?So if you trust finding a mate on Tinder,are you more likelyto trust finding a ride on BlaBlaCar? But from studying hundredsof networks and marketplaces,there is a common patternthat people follow,and I call it \"climbing the trust stack.\"Let me use BlaBlaCaras an example to bring it to life.On the first level,you have to trust the idea.So you have to trustthe idea of ride-sharingis safe and worth trying.The second level is about havingconfidence in the platform,that BlaBlaCar will help youif something goes wrong.And the third level is aboutusing little bits of informationto decide whetherthe other person is trustworthy. Now, the first timewe climb the trust stack,it feels weird, even risky,but we get to a pointwhere these ideas seem totally normal.Our behaviors transform,often relatively quickly.In other words, trust enableschange and innovation. So an idea that intrigued me,and I'd like you to consider,is whether we can better understandmajor waves of disruption and changein individuals in societythrough the lens of trust.Well, it turns outthat trust has only evolvedin three significant chaptersthroughout the course of human history:local, institutionaland what we're now entering, distributed. So for a long time,until the mid-1800s,trust was builtaround tight-knit relationships.So say I lived in a villagewith the first five rows of this audience,and we all knew one another,and say I wanted to borrow money.The man who had his eyes wide open,he might lend it to me,and if I didn't pay him back,you'd all know I was dodgy.I would get a bad reputation,and you would refuseto do business with me in the future.Trust was mostly localand accountability-based. In the mid-19th century,society went througha tremendous amount of change.People moved to fast-growing citiessuch as London and San Francisco,and a local banker herewas replaced by large corporationsthat didn't know us as individuals.We started to place our trustinto black box systems of authority,things like legal contractsand regulation and insurance,and less trust directly in other people.Trust became institutionaland commission-based. It's widely talked about how trustin institutions and many corporate brandshas been steadily decliningand continues to do so.I am constantly stunnedby major breaches of trust:the News Corp phone hacking,the Volkswagen emissions scandal,the widespread abusein the Catholic Church,the fact that only one measly bankerwent to jail after the greatfinancial crisis,or more recently the Panama Papersthat revealed how the richcan exploit offshore tax regimes.And the thing that really surprises meis why do leaders find it so hardto apologize, I mean sincerely apologize,when our trust is broken? It would be easy to concludethat institutional trust isn't workingbecause we are fed upwith the sheer audacityof dishonest elites,but what's happening nowruns deeper than the rampant questioningof the size and structure of institutions.We're starting to realizethat institutional trustwasn't designed for the digital age.Conventions of how trust is built,managed, lost and repaired —in brands, leaders and entire systems —is being turned upside down. Now, this is exciting,but it's frightening,because it forces many of usto have to rethinkhow trust is built and destroyedwith our customers, with our employees,even our loved ones. The other day, I was talking to the CEOof a leading international hotel brand,and as is often the case,we got onto the topic of Airbnb.And he admitted to methat he was perplexed by their success.He was perplexed at how a companythat depends on the willingnessof strangers to trust one anothercould work so well across 191 countries.So I said to himthat I had a confession to make,and he looked at me a bit strangely,and I said —and I'm sure many of youdo this as well —I don't always bother to hang my towels upwhen I'm finished in the hotel,but I would never do thisas a guest on Airbnb.And the reason why I would never do thisas a guest on Airbnbis because guests knowthat they'll be rated by hosts,and that those ratingsare likely to impact their abilityto transact in the future.It's a simple illustration of howonline trust will change our behaviorsin the real world,make us more accountablein ways we cannot yet even imagine. I am not saying we do not need hotelsor traditional forms of authority.But what we cannot denyis that the way trustflows through society is changing,and it's creating this big shiftaway from the 20th centurythat was defined by institutional trusttowards the 21st centurythat will be fueled by distributed trust.Trust is no longer top-down.It's being unbundled and inverted.It's no longer opaque and linear.A new recipe for trust is emergingthat once againis distributed amongst peopleand is accountability-based. And this shift is only going to acceleratewith the emergence of the blockchain,the innovative ledger technologyunderpinning Bitcoin.Now let's be honest,getting our heads aroundthe way blockchain worksis mind-blowing.And one of the reasons whyis it involves processingsome pretty complicated conceptswith terrible names.I mean, cryptographic algorithmsand hash functions,and people called miners,who verify transactions —all that was createdby this mysterious personor persons called Satoshi Nakamoto.Now, that is a massive trust leapthat hasn't happened yet. (Applause) But let's try to imagine this.So \"The Economist\"eloquently described the blockchainas the great chainof being sure about things.The easiest way I can describe itis imagine the blocks as spreadsheets,and they are filled with assets.So that could be a property title.It could be a stock trade.It could be a creative asset,such as the rights to a song.Every time something movesfrom one place on the registerto somewhere else,that asset transfer is time-stampedand publicly recorded on the blockchain.It's that simple. Right. So the real implication of the blockchainis that it removes the needfor any kind of third party,such as a lawyer,or a trusted intermediary,or maybe not a government intermediaryto facilitate the exchange.So if we go back to the trust stack,you still have to trust the idea,you have to trust the platform,but you don't have to trustthe other personin the traditional sense. The implications are huge.In the same way the internet blew openthe doors to an age of informationavailable to everyone,the blockchain will revolutionizetrust on a global scale. Now, I've waited to the endintentionally to mention Uber,because I recognizethat it is a contentiousand widely overused example,but in the context of a new era of trust,it's a great case study.Now, we will see cases of abuseof distributed trust.We've already seen this,and it can go horribly wrong.I am not surprised that we are seeingprotests from taxi associationsall around the worldtrying to get governments to ban Uberbased on claims that it is unsafe.I happened to be in Londonthe day that these protests took place,and I happened to notice a tweetfrom Matt Hancock, who isa British minister for business. And he wrote,\"Does anyone have details of this#Uber app everyone's talking about? (Laughter) I'd never heard of it until today.\"nNow, the taxi associations,they legitimized the first layerof the trust stack.They legitimized the ideathat they were trying to eliminate,and sign-ups increasedby 850 percent in 24 hours.Now, this is a really strong illustrationof how once a trust shift has happenedaround a behavior or an entire sector,you cannot reverse the story.Every day, five million peoplewill take a trust leapand ride with Uber.In China, on Didi,the ride-sharing platform,11 million rides taken every day.That's 127 rides per second,showing that this isa cross-cultural phenomenon. And the fascinating thing isthat both drivers and passengers reportthat seeing a nameand seeing someone's photoand their ratingmakes them feel safer,and as you may have experienced,even behave a little more nicelyin the taxi cab.Uber and Didi are earlybut powerful examplesof how technologyis creating trust between peoplein ways and on a scalenever possible before. Today, many of us are comfortablegetting into cars driven by strangers.We meet up with someonewe swiped right to be matched with.We share our homeswith people we do not know. This is just the beginning,because the real disruption happeningisn't technological.It's the trust shift it creates,and for my part, I want to help peopleunderstand this new era of trustso that we can get it rightand we can embracethe opportunities to redesign systemsthat are more transparent,inclusive and accountable. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Something profound is changing our concept of trust, says Rachel Botsman. While we used to place our trust in institutions like governments and banks, today we increasingly rely on others, often strangers, on platforms like Airbnb and Uber and through technologies like the blockchain. This new era of trust could bring with it a more transparent, inclusive and accountable society — if we get it right. Who do you trust?

62	"Have you ever noticedwhen you ask someone to talkabout a change they're makingfor the better in their personal lives,they're often really energetic?Whether it's training for a marathon,picking up an old hobby,or learning a new skill,for most people,self-transformation projectsoccupy a very positive emotional space. Self-transformation is empowering,energizing, even exhilarating.I mean just take a lookat some of the titles of self-help books:\"Awaken the Giant Within,\"\"Practicing the Power of Now,\"or here's a great onewe can all relate to,\"You are a Badass:How to Stop Doubting Your Greatnessand Start Living an Awesome Life.\"n(Laughter) When it comes to self-transformation,you can't help but geta sense of the excitement.But there's another type of transformationthat occupies a very differentemotional space.The transformation of organizations.If you're like most people,when you hear the words \"Our organizationis going to start a transformation,\"you're thinking, \"Uh-oh.\"n(Laughter) \"Layoffs.\"The blood drains from your face,your mind goes into overdrive,frantically searchingfor some place to run and hide. Well, you can run,but you really can't hide.Most of us spendthe majority of our waking hoursinvolved in organizations.And due to changes in globalization,changes due to advances in technologyand other factors,the reality is our organizationsare constantly having to adapt.In fact,I call this the eraof \"always-on\" transformation. When I shared this ideawith my wife Nicola,she said, \"Always-on transformation?That sounds exhausting.\"And that may beexactly what you're thinking —and you would be right.Particularly if we continue to approachthe transformation of organizationsthe way we always have been. But because we can't hide,we need to sort out two things.First,why is transformation so exhausting?And second, how do we fix it? First of all,let's acknowledge that change is hard.People naturally resist change,especially when it's imposed on them.But there are things that organizations dothat make change even harderand more exhaustingfor people than it needs to be.First of all,leaders often wait too long to act.As a result,everything is happening in crisis mode.Which, of course, tends to be exhausting.Or, given the urgency,what they'll do is they'll just focuson the short-term results,but that doesn't giveany hope for the future.Or they'll just takea superficial, one-off approach,hoping that they can returnback to business as usualas soon as the crisis is over. This kind of approachis kind of the way some studentsapproach preparing for standardized tests.In order to get test scores to go up,teachers will end up teaching to the test.Now, that approach can work;test results often do go up.But it fails the fundamentalgoal of education:to prepare studentsto succeed over the long term. So given these obstacles,what can we doto transform the waywe transform organizationsso rather than being exhausting,it's actually empowering and energizing?To do that, we need to focuson five strategic imperatives,all of which have one thing in common:putting people first. The first imperativefor putting people firstis to inspire through purpose.Most transformations havefinancial and operational goals.These are importantand they can be energizing to leaders,but they tend not to be very motivatingto most people in the organization.To motivate more broadly,the transformation needs to connectwith a deeper sense of purpose. Take LEGO.The LEGO Group has becomean extraordinary global company.Under their very capable leadership,they've actually undergonea series of transformations.While each of thesehas had a very specific focus,the North Star,linking and guiding all of them,has been Lego's powerful purpose:inspire and developthe builders of tomorrow.Expanding globally?It's not about increasing sales,but about giving millions of additionalchildren access to LEGO building bricks.Investment and innovation?It's not about developing new products,but about enabling more childrento experience the joyof learning through play.Not surprisingly,that deep sense of purpose tendsto be highly motivating to LEGO's people. The second imperativefor putting people firstis to go all in.Too many transformationsare nothing more thanhead-count cutting exercises;layoffs under the guise of transformation.In the face of relentless competition,it may well be that you willhave to take the painful decisionto downsize the organization,just as you may have to lose some weightin order to run a marathon.But losing weight alonewill not get you acrossthe finish line with a winning time.To winyou need to go all in.You need to go all in.Rather than just cutting costs,you need to think about initiativesthat will enable youto win in the medium term,initiatives to drive growth,actions that will fundamentallychange the way the company operates,and very importantly,investments to developthe leadership and the talent. The third imperativefor putting people firstis to enable people with the capabilitiesthat they need to succeedduring the transformation and beyond.Over the years I've competedin a number of triathlons.You know, frankly, I'm not that good,but I do have one distinct capability;I am remarkably fast at finding my bike. (Laughter) By the time I finish the swim,almost all the bikes are already gone. (Laughter) Real triathletes know that each leg —the swim, the bike, the run —really requires different capabilities,different tools,different skills, different techniques.Likewise when we transform organizations,we need to be surethat we're giving our peoplethe skills and the toolsthey need along the way. Chronos,a global software company,recognized the needto transfer from building products —software products —to building software as a service.To enable its peopleto take that transformation,first of all they invested in new toolsthat would enable their employeesto monitor the usage of the featuresas well as customer satisfactionwith the new service.They also invested in skill development,so that their employees would be ableto resolve customer serviceproblems on the spot.And very importantly,they also reinforced the collaborativebehaviors that would be requiredto deliver an end-to-endseamless customer experience.Because of these investments,rather than feeling overwhelmedby the transformation,Chronos employees actually felt energizedand empowered in their new roles. In the era of \"always-on\" transformation,change is a constant.My fourth imperative thereforeis to instill a cultureof continuous learning.When Satya Nadellabecame the CEO of Microsoftin February 2014,he embarked on an ambitioustransformation journeyto prepare the company to competein a mobile-first, cloud-first world.This included changes to strategy,the organizationand very importantly, the culture.Microsoft's culture at the time was oneof silos and internal competition —not exactly conducive to learning.Nadella took this head-on.He rallied his leadershiparound his visionfor a living, learning culture,shifting from a fixed mindset,where your role was to show upas the smartest person in the room,to a growth mindset,where your role was to listen, to learnand to bring out the best in people.Well, early days,Microsoft employees alreadynoticed this shift in the culture —clear evidence of Microsoftputting people first. My fifth and final imperativeis specifically for leaders.In a transformation,a leader needs to have a vision,a clear road map with milestones,and then you need to hold peopleaccountable for results.In other words, you need to be directive.But in order to capturethe hearts and minds of people,you also need to be inclusive.Inclusive leadershipis critical to putting people first. I live in the San Francisco Bay area.And right now,our basketball teamis the best in the league.We won the 2015 championship,and we're favored to win again this year.There are many explanations for this.They have some fabulous players,but one of the key reasonsis their head coach, Steve Kerr,is an inclusive leader.When Kerr came to the Warriors in 2014,the Warriors were lookingfor a major transformation.They hadn't won a nationalchampionship since 1975. Kerr came in, and he had a clear vision,and he immediately got to work.From the outset,he reached out and engagedthe players and the staff.He created an environment of open debateand solicited suggestions.During games he would often ask,\"What are you seeing that I'm missing?\"nOne the best examples of thiscame in game four of the 2015 finals.The Warriors were down two games to onewhen Kerr made the decisionto change the starting lineup;a bold move by any measure.The Warriors won the gameand went on to win the championship.And it is widely viewedthat that move wasthe pivotal move in their victory. Interestingly, it wasn'tactually Kerr's idea.It was the idea of his 28-year-oldassistant, Nick U'Ren.Because of Kerr's leadership style,U'Ren felt comfortablebringing the idea forward.And Kerr not only listened,but he implemented the ideaand then afterwards,gave U'Ren all the credit —actions all consistent with Kerr'shighly inclusive approach to leadership. In the era of \"always-on\" transformation,organizations are alwaysgoing to be transforming.But doing so does nothave to be exhausting.We owe it to ourselves,to our organizationsand to society more broadlyto boldly transformour approach to transformation.To do that,we need to start putting people first. Thank you. (Applause) Who says change needs to be hard? Organizational change expert Jim Hemerling thinks adapting your business in today's constantly-evolving world can be invigorating instead of exhausting. He outlines five imperatives, centered around putting people first, for turning company reorganization into an empowering, energizing task for all.

64	"So, has everybody heard of CRISPR?I would be shocked if you hadn't. This is a technology —it's for genome editing —and it's so versatile and so controversialthat it's sparking all sortsof really interesting conversations.Should we bring back the woolly mammoth?Should we edit a human embryo?And my personal favorite:How can we justifywiping out an entire speciesthat we consider harmful to humansoff the face of the Earth,using this technology? This type of scienceis moving much fasterthan the regulatory mechanismsthat govern it.And so, for the past six years,I've made it my personal missionto make sure that as many peopleas possible understandthese types of technologiesand their implications. Now, CRISPR has been the subjectof a huge media hype,and the words that are used most oftenare \"easy\" and \"cheap.\"So what I want to do is drill downa little bit deeperand look into some of the mythsand the realities around CRISPR. If you're trying to CRISPR a genome,the first thing that you have to dois damage the DNA.The damage comes in the formof a double-strand breakthrough the double helix.And then the cellular repairprocesses kick in,and then we convincethose repair processesto make the edit that we want,and not a natural edit.That's how it works.It's a two-part system.You've got a Cas9 proteinand something called a guide RNA.I like to think of it as a guided missile.So the Cas9 —I love to anthropomorphize —so the Cas9 is kind of this Pac-Man thingthat wants to chew DNA,and the guide RNA is the leashthat's keeping it out of the genomeuntil it finds the exact spotwhere it matches.And the combination of those twois called CRISPR.It's a system that we stolefrom an ancient, ancientbacterial immune system. The part that's amazing about itis that the guide RNA,only 20 letters of it,are what target the system.This is really easy to design,and it's really cheap to buy.So that's the partthat is modular in the system;everything else stays the same.This makes it a remarkably easyand powerful system to use. The guide RNA and the Cas9protein complex togethergo bouncing along the genome,and when they find a spotwhere the guide RNA matches,then it inserts between the two strandsof the double helix,it rips them apart,that triggers the Cas9 protein to cut,and all of a sudden,you've got a cell that's in total panicbecause now it's got a pieceof DNA that's broken. What does it do?It calls its first responders.There are two major repair pathways.The first just takes the DNAand shoves the two pieces back together.This isn't a very efficient system,because what happens issometimes a base drops outor a base is added.It's an OK way to maybe, like,knock out a gene,but it's not the way that we really wantto do genome editing. The second repair pathwayis a lot more interesting.In this repair pathway,it takes a homologous piece of DNA.And now mind you, in a diploidorganism like people,we've got one copy of our genomefrom our mom and one from our dad,so if one gets damaged,it can use the otherchromosome to repair it.So that's where this comes from.The repair is made,and now the genome is safe again. The way that we can hijack thisis we can feed it a false piece of DNA,a piece that has homology on both endsbut is different in the middle.So now, you can putwhatever you want in the centerand the cell gets fooled.So you can change a letter,you can take letters out,but most importantly,you can stuff new DNA in,kind of like a Trojan horse. CRISPR is going to be amazing,in terms of the number of differentscientific advancesthat it's going to catalyze.The thing that's special about itis this modular targeting system.I mean, we've been shoving DNAinto organisms for years, right?But because of the modulartargeting system,we can actually put itexactly where we want it. The thing is that there'sa lot of talk about it being cheapand it being easy.And I run a community lab.I'm starting to get emails from peoplethat say stuff like,n\"Hey, can I come to your open nightand, like, maybe use CRISPRand engineer my genome?\"n(Laugher) Like, seriously. I'm, \"No, you can't.\"n(Laughter) \"But I've heard it's cheap.I've heard it's easy.\"nWe're going to explore that a little bit.So, how cheap is it?Yeah, it is cheap in comparison.It's going to take the cost of the averagematerials for an experimentfrom thousands of dollarsto hundreds of dollars,and it cuts the time a lot, too.It can cut it from weeks to days.That's great.You still need a professional labto do the work in;you're not going to do anything meaningfuloutside of a professional lab.I mean, don't listen to anyone who saysyou can do this sort of stuffon your kitchen table.It's really not easyto do this kind of work.Not to mention,there's a patent battle going on,so even if you do invent something,the Broad Institute and UC Berkeleyare in this incredible patent battle.It's really fascinatingto watch it happen,because they're accusing each otherof fraudulent claimsand then they've got people saying,\"Oh, well, I signedmy notebook here or there.\"This isn't going to be settled for years.And when it is,you can bet you're going to pay someonea really hefty licensing feein order to use this stuff.So, is it really cheap?Well, it's cheap if you're doingbasic research and you've got a lab. How about easy?Let's look at that claim.The devil is always in the details.We don't really knowthat much about cells.They're still kind of black boxes.For example, we don't knowwhy some guide RNAs work really welland some guide RNAs don't.We don't know why some cellswant to do one repair pathwayand some cells would rather do the other. And besides that,there's the whole problemof getting the system into the cellin the first place.In a petri dish, that's not that hard,but if you're trying to do iton a whole organism,it gets really tricky.It's OK if you use somethinglike blood or bone marrow —those are the targetsof a lot of research now. There was a great storyof some little girlwho they saved from leukemiaby taking the blood out, editing it,and putting it backwith a precursor of CRISPR.And this is a line of researchthat people are going to do.But right now, if you want to getinto the whole body,you're probably goingto have to use a virus.So you take the virus,you put the CRISPR into it,you let the virus infect the cell.But now you've got this virus in there,and we don't know what the long-termeffects of that are.Plus, CRISPR has some off-target effects,a very small percentage,but they're still there.What's going to happenover time with that? These are not trivial questions,and there are scientiststhat are trying to solve them,and they will eventually,hopefully, be solved.But it ain't plug-and-play,not by a long shot.So: Is it really easy?Well, if you spend a few yearsworking it out in your particular system,yes, it is. Now the other thing is,we don't really know that much about howto make a particular thing happenby changing particular spotsin the genome.We're a long way away from figuring outhow to give a pig wings, for example.Or even an extra leg — I'd settlefor an extra leg.That would be kind of cool, right?But what is happeningis that CRISPR is being usedby thousands and thousands of scientiststo do really, really important work,like making better modelsof diseases in animals, for example,or for taking pathwaysthat produce valuable chemicalsand getting them into industrialproduction in fermentation vats,or even doing really basic researchon what genes do. This is the story of CRISPRwe should be telling,and I don't like itthat the flashier aspects of itare drowning all of this out.Lots of scientists did a lot of workto make CRISPR happen,and what's interesting to meis that these scientistsare being supported by our society. Think about it.We've got an infrastructure that allowsa certain percentage of peopleto spend all their time doing research.That makes us all the inventors of CRISPR,and I would say that makes us allthe shepherds of CRISPR.We all have a responsibility. So I would urge you to really learnabout these types of technologies,because, really, only in that wayare we going to be able to guidethe development of these technologies,the use of these technologiesand make sure that, in the end,it's a positive outcome —for both the planet and for us. Thanks. (Applause) Should we bring back the wooly mammoth? Or edit a human embryo? Or wipe out an entire species that we consider harmful? The genome-editing technology CRISPR has made extraordinary questions like these legitimate — but how does it work? Scientist and community lab advocate Ellen Jorgensen is on a mission to explain the myths and realities of CRISPR, hype-free, to the non-scientists among us. Ellen Jorgensen is at the leading edge of the do-it-yourself biotechnology movement, bringing scientific exploration and understanding to the public.

65	"I'm going to talkabout a failure of intuitionthat many of us suffer from.It's really a failureto detect a certain kind of danger.I'm going to describe a scenariothat I think is both terrifyingand likely to occur,and that's not a good combination,as it turns out.And yet rather than be scared,most of you will feelthat what I'm talking aboutis kind of cool. I'm going to describehow the gains we makein artificial intelligencecould ultimately destroy us.And in fact, I think it's very difficultto see how they won't destroy usor inspire us to destroy ourselves.And yet if you're anything like me,you'll find that it's funto think about these things.And that response is part of the problem.OK? That response should worry you.And if I were to convince you in this talkthat we were likelyto suffer a global famine,either because of climate changeor some other catastrophe,and that your grandchildren,or their grandchildren,are very likely to live like this,you wouldn't think,\"Interesting.I like this TED Talk.\"nFamine isn't fun.Death by science fiction,on the other hand, is fun,and one of the things that worries me mostabout the development of AI at this pointis that we seem unable to marshalan appropriate emotional responseto the dangers that lie ahead.I am unable to marshal this response,and I'm giving this talk. It's as though we stand before two doors.Behind door number one,we stop making progressin building intelligent machines.Our computer hardware and softwarejust stops getting better for some reason.Now take a momentto consider why this might happen.I mean, given how valuableintelligence and automation are,we will continue to improve our technologyif we are at all able to.What could stop us from doing this?A full-scale nuclear war?A global pandemic?An asteroid impact?Justin Bieber becomingpresident of the United States? (Laughter) The point is, something would have todestroy civilization as we know it.You have to imaginehow bad it would have to beto prevent us from makingimprovements in our technologypermanently,generation after generation.Almost by definition,this is the worst thingthat's ever happened in human history. So the only alternative,and this is what liesbehind door number two,is that we continueto improve our intelligent machinesyear after year after year.At a certain point, we will buildmachines that are smarter than we are,and once we have machinesthat are smarter than we are,they will begin to improve themselves.And then we risk whatthe mathematician IJ Good calledan \"intelligence explosion,\"that the process could get away from us. Now, this is often caricatured,as I have here,as a fear that armies of malicious robotswill attack us.But that isn't the most likely scenario.It's not that our machineswill become spontaneously malevolent.The concern is reallythat we will build machinesthat are so muchmore competent than we arethat the slightest divergencebetween their goals and our owncould destroy us. Just think about how we relate to ants.We don't hate them.We don't go out of our way to harm them.In fact, sometimeswe take pains not to harm them.We step over them on the sidewalk.But whenever their presenceseriously conflicts with one of our goals,let's say when constructinga building like this one,we annihilate them without a qualm.The concern is that we willone day build machinesthat, whether they're conscious or not,could treat us with similar disregard. Now, I suspect this seemsfar-fetched to many of you.I bet there are those of you who doubtthat superintelligent AI is possible,much less inevitable.But then you must find something wrongwith one of the following assumptions.And there are only three of them. Intelligence is a matter of informationprocessing in physical systems.Actually, this is a little bit morethan an assumption.We have already builtnarrow intelligence into our machines,and many of these machines performat a level of superhumanintelligence already.And we know that mere mattercan give rise to what is called\"general intelligence,\"an ability to think flexiblyacross multiple domains,because our brains have managed it. Right?I mean, there's just atoms in here,and as long as we continueto build systems of atomsthat display more and moreintelligent behavior,we will eventually,unless we are interrupted,we will eventuallybuild general intelligenceinto our machines. It's crucial to realizethat the rate of progress doesn't matter,because any progressis enough to get us into the end zone.We don't need Moore's law to continue.We don't need exponential progress.We just need to keep going. The second assumptionis that we will keep going.We will continue to improveour intelligent machines.And given the value of intelligence —I mean, intelligence is eitherthe source of everything we valueor we need it to safeguardeverything we value.It is our most valuable resource.So we want to do this.We have problemsthat we desperately need to solve.We want to cure diseaseslike Alzheimer's and cancer.We want to understand economic systems.We want to improve our climate science.So we will do this, if we can.The train is already out of the station,and there's no brake to pull. Finally, we don't standon a peak of intelligence,or anywhere near it, likely.And this really is the crucial insight.This is what makesour situation so precarious,and this is what makes our intuitionsabout risk so unreliable. Now, just consider the smartest personwho has ever lived.On almost everyone's shortlist hereis John von Neumann.I mean, the impression that von Neumannmade on the people around him,and this included the greatestmathematicians and physicists of his time,is fairly well-documented.If only half the storiesabout him are half true,there's no questionhe's one of the smartest peoplewho has ever lived.So consider the spectrum of intelligence.Here we have John von Neumann.And then we have you and me.And then we have a chicken. (Laughter) Sorry, a chicken. (Laughter) There's no reason for me to make this talkmore depressing than it needs to be. (Laughter) It seems overwhelmingly likely, however,that the spectrum of intelligenceextends much furtherthan we currently conceive,and if we build machinesthat are more intelligent than we are,they will very likelyexplore this spectrumin ways that we can't imagine,and exceed us in waysthat we can't imagine. And it's important to recognize thatthis is true by virtue of speed alone.Right? So imagine if we just builta superintelligent AIthat was no smarterthan your average team of researchersat Stanford or MIT.Well, electronic circuitsfunction about a million times fasterthan biochemical ones,so this machine should thinkabout a million times fasterthan the minds that built it.So you set it running for a week,and it will perform 20,000 yearsof human-level intellectual work,week after week after week.How could we even understand,much less constrain,a mind making this sort of progress? The other thing that's worrying, frankly,is that, imagine the best case scenario.So imagine we hit upon a designof superintelligent AIthat has no safety concerns.We have the perfect designthe first time around.It's as though we've been handed an oraclethat behaves exactly as intended.Well, this machine would bethe perfect labor-saving device.It can design the machinethat can build the machinethat can do any physical work,powered by sunlight,more or less for the costof raw materials.So we're talking aboutthe end of human drudgery.We're also talking about the endof most intellectual work. So what would apes like ourselvesdo in this circumstance?Well, we'd be free to play Frisbeeand give each other massages.Add some LSD and somequestionable wardrobe choices,and the whole worldcould be like Burning Man. (Laughter) Now, that might sound pretty good,but ask yourself what would happenunder our current economicand political order?It seems likely that we would witnessa level of wealth inequalityand unemploymentthat we have never seen before.Absent a willingnessto immediately put this new wealthto the service of all humanity,a few trillionaires could gracethe covers of our business magazineswhile the rest of the worldwould be free to starve. And what would the Russiansor the Chinese doif they heard that some companyin Silicon Valleywas about to deploy a superintelligent AI?This machine would be capableof waging war,whether terrestrial or cyber,with unprecedented power.This is a winner-take-all scenario.To be six months aheadof the competition hereis to be 500,000 years ahead,at a minimum.So it seems that even mere rumorsof this kind of breakthroughcould cause our species to go berserk. Now, one of the most frightening things,in my view, at this moment,are the kinds of thingsthat AI researchers saywhen they want to be reassuring.And the most common reasonwe're told not to worry is time.This is all a long way off,don't you know.This is probably 50 or 100 years away.One researcher has said,\"Worrying about AI safetyis like worryingabout overpopulation on Mars.\"This is the Silicon Valley versionof \"don't worry yourpretty little head about it.\"n(Laughter) No one seems to noticethat referencing the time horizonis a total non sequitur.If intelligence is just a matterof information processing,and we continue to improve our machines,we will producesome form of superintelligence.And we have no ideahow long it will take usto create the conditionsto do that safely.Let me say that again.We have no idea how long it will take usto create the conditionsto do that safely. And if you haven't noticed,50 years is not what it used to be.This is 50 years in months.This is how long we've had the iPhone.This is how long \"The Simpsons\"has been on television.Fifty years is not that much timeto meet one of the greatest challengesour species will ever face.Once again, we seem to be failingto have an appropriate emotional responseto what we have every reasonto believe is coming. The computer scientist Stuart Russellhas a nice analogy here.He said, imagine that we receiveda message from an alien civilization,which read:\"People of Earth,we will arrive on your planet in 50 years.Get ready.\"And now we're just counting downthe months until the mothership lands?We would feel a littlemore urgency than we do. Another reason we're told not to worryis that these machinescan't help but share our valuesbecause they will be literallyextensions of ourselves.They'll be grafted onto our brains,and we'll essentiallybecome their limbic systems.Now take a moment to considerthat the safestand only prudent path forward,recommended,is to implant this technologydirectly into our brains.Now, this may in fact be the safestand only prudent path forward,but usually one's safety concernsabout a technologyhave to be pretty much worked outbefore you stick it inside your head. (Laughter) The deeper problem is thatbuilding superintelligent AI on its ownseems likely to be easierthan building superintelligent AIand having the completed neurosciencethat allows us to seamlesslyintegrate our minds with it.And given that the companiesand governments doing this workare likely to perceive themselvesas being in a race against all others,given that to win this raceis to win the world,provided you don't destroy itin the next moment,then it seems likelythat whatever is easier to dowill get done first. Now, unfortunately,I don't have a solution to this problem,apart from recommendingthat more of us think about it.I think we need somethinglike a Manhattan Projecton the topic of artificial intelligence.Not to build it, because I thinkwe'll inevitably do that,but to understandhow to avoid an arms raceand to build it in a waythat is aligned with our interests.When you're talkingabout superintelligent AIthat can make changes to itself,it seems that we only have one chanceto get the initial conditions right,and even then we will need to absorbthe economic and politicalconsequences of getting them right. But the moment we admitthat information processingis the source of intelligence,that some appropriate computational systemis what the basis of intelligence is,and we admit that we will improvethese systems continuously,and we admit that the horizonof cognition very likely far exceedswhat we currently know,then we have to admitthat we are in the processof building some sort of god.Now would be a good timeto make sure it's a god we can live with. Thank you very much. (Applause) Scared of superintelligent AI? You should be, says neuroscientist and philosopher Sam Harris — and not just in some theoretical way. We're going to build superhuman machines, says Harris, but we haven't yet grappled with the problems associated with creating something that may treat us the way we treat ants. Sam Harris's work focuses on how our growing understanding of ourselves and the world is changing our sense of how we should live.

66	"Two hundred years of modern science.We have to admitthat our performance is not great.The machines we build continueto suffer from mechanical failures.The houses we builddo not survive severe earthquakes.But we shouldn't be so criticalof our scientists for a simple reason:they didn't have much time.Two hundred years is not a lot of time,while nature had three billion yearsto perfect some of the mostamazing materials,that we wish we had in our possession.Remember, these materialscarry a quality assuranceof three billion years. Take, for example, sequoia trees.They carry hundreds of tonsfor hundreds of yearsin cold weather, in warm climates,UV light.Yet, if you look at the structureby high-resolution electron microscopy,and you ask yourself, what is it made of,surprisingly, it's made of sugar.Well, not exactly as we drink in our tea.It's actually a nanofibercalled nanocrystalline cellulose.And this nanocrystalline celluloseis so strong, on a weight basis,it's about 10 times stronger than steel.Yet it's made of sugar. So scientists all over the worldbelieve that nanocelluloseis going to be one of the most importantmaterials for the entire industry.But here's the problem:say you want to buya half a ton of nanocelluloseto build a boat or an airplane.Well, you can Google, you can eBay,you can even Alibaba.You won't find it.Of course, you're going to findthousands of scientific papers —great papers, where scientistsare going to say this is a great material,there are lots of thingswe can do with it.But no commercial source. So we at the Hebrew University,together with our partners in Sweden,decided to focus on the developmentof an industrial-scale processto produce this nanocellulose.And, of course,we didn't want to cut trees.So we were looking for another sourceof raw material,and we found one — in fact,the sludge of the paper industry.The reason: there is a lot of it.Europe alone produces 11 million tonsof that material annually.It's the equivalent of a mountainthree kilometers high,sitting on a soccer field.And we produce this mountain every year.So for everybody,it's an environmental problem,and for us, it's a gold mine. So now, we are actually producing,on an industrial scale in Israel,nanocellulose, and very soon, in Sweden.We can do a lot of thingswith the material.For example,we have shown that by addingonly a small percent of nanocelluloseinto cotton fibers, the sameas my shirt is made of,it increases its strength dramatically.So this can be usedfor making amazing things,like super-fabrics for industrialand medical applications.But this is not the only thing.For example, self-standing,self-supporting structures,like the shelters that you can see now,actually are now showcasingin the Venice Biennale for Architecture. Nature actually didn't stop its wondersin the plant kingdom.Think about insects.Cat fleas, for example,have the ability to jumpabout a hundred times their height.That's amazing.It's the equivalent of a personstanding in the middleof Liberty Island in New York,and in a single jump,going to the top of the Statue of Liberty.I'm sure everybody would like to do that.So the question is:How do cat fleas do it? It turns out, they makethis wonderful material,which is called resilin.In simple words, resilin,which is a protein,is the most elastic rubber on Earth.You can stretch it,you can squish it,and it doesn't lose almost any energyto the environment.When you release it — snap!It brings back all the energy.So I'm sure everybodywould like to have that material.But here's the problem:to catch cat fleas is difficult. (Laughter) Why? Because they are jumpy. (Laughter) But now, it's actuallyenough to catch one.Now we can extract its DNAand read how cat fleas make the resilin,and clone it into a less-jumpyorganism like a plant.So that's exactly what we did.Now we have the abilityto produce lots of resilin. Well, my team decided to do somethingreally cool at the university.They decided to combinethe strongest materialproduced by the plant kingdomwith the most elastic materialproduced by the insect kingdom —nanocellulose with resilin.And the result is amazing.This material, in fact, is tough,elastic and transparent.So there are lots of thingsthat can be done with this material.For example, next-generation sport shoes,so we can jump higher, run faster.And even touch screensfor computers and smartphones,that won't break. Well, the problem is,we continue to implantsynthetic implants in our body,which we glue and screw into our body.And I'm going to saythat this is not a good idea.Why? Because they fail.This synthetic material fails,just like this plastic fork,that is not strong enoughfor its performance.But sometimes they are too strong,and therefore their mechanicalproperties do not really fittheir surrounding tissues. But in fact, the reasonis much more fundamental.The reason is that in nature,there is no one therethat actually takes my headand screws it onto my neck,or takes my skinand glues it onto my body.In nature, everything is self-assembled.So every living cell,whether coming from a plant,insect or human being,has a DNA that encodesfor nanobio building blocks.Many times they are proteins.Other times, they are enzymesthat make other materials,like polysaccharides, fatty acids.And the common featureabout all these materialsis that they need no one.They recognize each otherand self-assembleinto structures — scaffoldson which cells are proliferatingto give tissues.They develop into organs,and together bring life. So we at the Hebrew University,about 10 years ago, decided to focuson probably the most importantbiomaterial for humans,which is collagen.Why collagen?Because collagen accounts forabout 25 percent of our dry weight.We have nothing more than collagen,other than water, in our body.So I always like to say,anyone who is in the replacementparts of human beingswould like to have collagen. Admittedly, before we started our project,there were already morethan 1,000 medical implantsmade of collagen.You know, simple things likedermal fillers to reduce wrinkles,augment lips,and other, more sophisticatedmedical implants, like heart valves.So where is the problem?Well, the problem is the source.The source of all that collagenis actually coming from dead bodies:dead pigs, dead cowsand even human cadavers.So safety is a big issue.But it's not the only one.Also, the quality. Now here, I have a personal interest.This is my father, Zvi,in our winery in Israel.A heart valve, very similarto the one that I showed you before,seven years ago,was implanted in his body.Now, the scientific literature saysthat these heart valves start to fail10 years after the operation.No wonder:they are made from old, used tissues,just like this wall made of bricksthat is falling apart.Yeah, of course, I can takethose bricks and build a new wall.But it's not going to be the same.So the US Food and Drug Administrationmade a notice already in 2007,asking the companies to start to lookfor better alternatives. So that's exactly what we did.We decided to clone all the fivehuman genes responsiblefor making type I collagen in humansinto a transgenic tobacco plant.So now, the plant has the abilityto make human collagen brand new,untouched.This is amazing.Actually, it's happening now.Today in Israel, we grow itin 25,000 square meters of greenhousesall over the country.The farmers receivesmall plantlets of tobacco.It looks exactly like regular tobacco,except that they have five human genes.They're responsible for makingtype I collagen.We grow them for about 50 to 70 days,we harvest the leaves,and then the leaves are transportedby cooling trucks to the factory.There, the process of extractingthe collagen starts. Now, if you ever made a pesto —essentially, the same thing. (Laughter) You crush the leaves, you getthe juice that contains the collagen.We concentrate the protein,transfer the protein to clean roomsfor the final purification,and the end result is a collagenidentical to what we have in our body —untouched, brand newand from which we makedifferent medical implants:bone void fillers, for example,for severe bone fractures, spinal fusion.And more recently, even,we've been able to launchinto the market here in Europea flowable gel that is usedfor diabetic foot ulcers,that is now approvedfor use in the clinic. This is not science fiction.This is happening now.We are using plantsto make medical implantsfor replacement parts for human beings.In fact, more recently,we've been able to make collagen fiberswhich are six times strongerthan the Achilles tendon.That's amazing. Together with our partners from Ireland,we thought about the next thing:adding resilin to those fibers.By doing that,we've been able to make a superfiberwhich is about 380 percent tougher,and 300 percent more elastic.So oddly enough, in the future,when a patient is transplantedwith artificial tendons or ligamentsmade from these fibers,we'll have better performanceafter the surgerythan we had before the injury. So what's for the future?In the future, we believewe'll be able to makemany nanobio building blocksthat nature provided for us —collagen, nanocellulose,resilin and many more.And that will enable us to makebetter machines perform better,even the heart.Now, this heartis not going to be the sameas we can get from a donor.It will be better.It actually will perform betterand will last longer. My friend Zion Suliman once told mea smart sentence.He said, \"If you want a new idea,you should open an old book.\"And I'm going to saythat the book was written.It was written over three billion yearsof evolution.And the text is the DNA of life.All we have to dois read this text,embrace nature's gift to usand start our progress from here. Thank you. (Applause) What do you get when you combine the strongest materials from the plant world with the most elastic ones from the insect kingdom?

68	"Imagine that you're a pig farmer.You live on a small farmin the Philippines.Your animals are your family'ssole source of income —as long as they're healthy.You know that any day,one of your pigs can catch the flu,the swine flu.Living in tight quarters,one pig coughing and sneezingmay soon lead to the next pigcoughing and sneezing,until an outbreak of swine fluhas taken over your farm.If it's a bad enough virus,the health of your herd may be gonein the blink of an eye.If you called in a veterinarian,he or she would visit your farmand take samplesfrom your pigs' noses and mouths.But then they would have to driveback into the cityto test those samplesin their central lab.Two weeks later,you'd hear back the results.Two weeks may be just enough timefor infection to spreadand take away your way of life. But it doesn't have to be that way.Today, farmers can takethose samples themselves.They can jump right into the penand swab their pigs' noses and mouthswith a little filter paper,place that little filter paperin a tiny tube,and mix it with some chemicalsthat will extract genetic materialfrom their pigs' noses and mouths.And without leaving their farms,they take a drop of that genetic materialand put it into a little analyzersmaller than a shoebox,program it to detect DNA or RNAfrom the swine flu virus,and within one hour get back the results,visualize the results.This reality is possiblebecause today we're living in the eraof personal DNA technology.Every one of us can actuallytest DNA ourselves. DNA is the fundamental moleculethe carries genetic instructionsthat help build the living world.Humans have DNA.Pigs have DNA.Even bacteria and someviruses have DNA too.The genetic instructions encoded in DNAinform how our bodies develop,grow, function.And in many cases, that same informationcan trigger disease.Your genetic informationis strung into a long and twistedmolecule, the DNA double helix,that has over three billion letters,beginning to end.But the lines that carrymeaningful informationare usually very short —a few dozen to severalthousand letters long.So when we're looking to answera question based on DNA,we actually don't need to readall those three billionletters, typically.That would be like getting hungry at nightand having to flip throughthe whole phone bookfrom cover to cover,pausing at every line,just to find the nearest pizza joint. (Laughter) Luckily, three decades ago,humans started to invent toolsthat can find any specific lineof genetic information.These DNA machines are wonderful.They can find any line in DNA.But once they find it,that DNA is still tiny, and surroundedby so much other DNA,that what these machines then dois copy the target gene,and one copy piles on top of another,millions and millionsand millions of copies,until that gene stands outagainst the rest;until we can visualize it,interpret it, read it, understand it,until we can answer:Does my pig have the flu?Or other questions buried in our own DNA:Am I at risk of cancer?Am I of Irish descent?Is that child my son? (Laughter) This ability to make copies of DNA,as simple as it sounds,has transformed our world.Scientists use it every dayto detect and address disease,to create innovative medicines,to modify foods,to assess whether our food is safe to eator whether it's contaminatedwith deadly bacteria.Even judges use the outputof these machines in courtto decide whether someone is innocentor guilty based on DNA evidence.The inventor of this DNA-copying techniquewas awarded the Nobel Prizein Chemistry in 1993.But for 30 years,the power of genetic analysishas been confined to the ivory tower,or bigwig PhD scientist work.Well, several companies around the worldare working on makingthis same technology accessibleto everyday people like the pig farmer,like you. I cofounded one of these companies.Three years ago,together with a fellow biologistand friend of mine,Zeke Alvarez Saavedra,we decided to make personal DNA machinesthat anyone could use.Our goal was to bring DNA scienceto more people in new places.We started working in our basements.We had a simple question:What could the world look likeif everyone could analyze DNA?We were curious,as curious as you would have beenif I had shown you this picture in 1980. (Laughter) You would have thought, \"Wow!I can now callmy Aunt Glenda from the carand wish her a happy birthday.I can call anyone, anytime.This is the future!\"Little did you know,you would tap on that phoneto make dinner reservationsfor you and Aunt Glendato celebrate together.With another tap,you'd be ordering her gift.And yet one more tap,and you'd be \"liking\"Auntie Glenda on Facebook.And all of this,while sitting on the toilet. (Laughter) It is notoriously hard to predictwhere new technology might take us.And the same is truefor personal DNA technology today. For example, I could never have imaginedthat a truffle farmer, of all people,would use personal DNA machines.Dr. Paul Thomas growstruffles for a living.We see him pictured here,holding the first UK-cultivated trufflein his hands, on one of his farms.Truffles are this delicacythat stems from a fungusgrowing on the roots of living trees.And it's a rare fungus.Some species may fetch 3,000,7,000, or more dollars per kilogram.I learned from Paulthat the stakes for a truffle farmercan be really high.When he sources new trufflesto grow on his farms,he's exposed to the threatof knockoffs —truffles that look and feellike the real thing,but they're of lower quality.But even to a trained eye like Paul's,even when looked at under a microscope,these truffles can pass for authentic.So in order to growthe highest quality truffles,the ones that chefsall over the world will fight over,Paul has to use DNA analysis.Isn't that mind-blowing?I bet you will never lookat that black truffle risotto againwithout thinking of its genes. (Laughter) But personal DNA machinescan also save human lives.Professor Ian Goodfellow is a virologistat the University of Cambridge.Last year he traveled to Sierra Leone.When the Ebola outbreakbroke out in Western Africa,he quickly realized that doctors therelacked the basic toolsto detect and combat disease.Results could takeup to a week to come back —that's way too long for the patientsand the families who are suffering.Ian decided to move his labinto Makeni, Sierra Leone.Here we see Ian Goodfellowmoving over 10 tons of equipmentinto a pop-up tentthat he would equip to detectand diagnose the virusand sequence it within 24 hours.But here's a surprise:the same equipment that Ian could useat his lab in the UKto sequence and diagnose Ebola,just wouldn't work under these conditions.We're talking 35 Celsius heatand over 90 percent humidity here.But instead, Ian could usepersonal DNA machinessmall enough to be placedin front of the air-conditioning unitto keep sequencing the virusand keep saving lives. This may seem likean extreme place for DNA analysis,but let's move on to an evenmore extreme environment:outer space.Let's talk about DNA analysis in space.When astronauts live aboardthe International Space Station,they're orbiting the planet250 miles high.They're travelingat 17,000 miles per hour.Picture that —you're seeing 15 sunsetsand sunrises every day.You're also living in microgravity,floating.And under these conditions,our bodies can do funky things.One of these things is thatour immune systems get suppressed,making astronauts more prone to infection. A 16-year-old girl,a high school student from New York,Anna-Sophia Boguraev,wondered whether changesto the DNA of astronautscould be relatedto this immune suppression,and through a science competitioncalled \"Genes In Space,\"Anna-Sophia designed an experimentto test this hypothesisusing a personal DNA machineaboard the International Space Station.Here we see Anna-Sophiaon April 8, 2016, in Cape Canaveral,watching her experiment launchto the International Space Station.That cloud of smoke is the rocketthat brought Anna-Sophia's experimentto the International Space Station,where, three days later,astronaut Tim Peakecarried out her experiment —in microgravity.Personal DNA machines are nowaboard the International Space Station,where they can help monitorliving conditionsand protect the lives of astronauts. A 16-year-old designing a DNA experimentto protect the lives of astronautsmay seem like a rarity,the mark of a child genius.Well, to me, it signalssomething bigger:that DNA technology is finallywithin the reach of every one of you. A few years ago,a college student armedwith a personal computercould code an app,an app that is now a social networkwith more than one billion users.Could we be moving into a worldof one personal DNA machine in every home? I know families who are alreadyliving in this reality.The Daniels family, for example,set up a DNA lab in the basementof their suburban Chicago home.This is not a familymade of PhD scientists.This is a family like any other.They just like to spend time togetherdoing fun, creative things.By day, Brian is an executiveat a private equity firm.At night and on weekends,he experiments with DNAalongside his kids, ages seven and nine,as a way to explore the living world.Last time I called them,they were checking out homegrown producefrom the backyard garden.They were testing tomatoesthat they had picked,taking the flesh of their skin,putting it in a test tube,mixing it with chemicals to extract DNAand then using their home DNA copierto test those tomatoesfor genetically engineered traits. For the Daniels family,the personal DNA machineis like the chemistry setfor the 21st century.Most of us may not yetbe diagnosing genetic conditionsin our kitchen sinksor doing at-home paternity testing. (Laughter) But we've definitely reacheda point in historywhere every one of you could actuallyget hands-on with DNAin your kitchen.You could copy, paste and analyze DNAand extract meaningfulinformation from it.And it's at times like thisthat profound transformationis bound to happen;moments when a transformative,powerful technologythat was before limitedto a select few in the ivory tower,finally becomes within the reachof every one of us,from farmers to schoolchildren.Think about the momentwhen phones stopped beingplugged into the wall by cords,or when computers left the mainframeand entered your home or your office. The ripples of the personal DNA revolutionmay be hard to predict,but one thing is certain:revolutions don't go backwards,and DNA technology is already spreadingfaster than our imagination. So if you're curious,get up close and personalwith DNA — today.It is in our DNA to be curious. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) From improving vaccines to modifying crops to solving crimes, DNA technology has transformed our world. Now, for the first time in history, anyone can experiment with DNA at home, in their kitchen, using a device smaller than a shoebox. We are living in a personal DNA revolution, says biotech entrepreneur Sebastian Kraves, where the secrets buried in DNA are yours to find. Sebastian Kraves wants to bring DNA science to more people in new places. Sebastian Kraves wants to bring DNA science to more people in new places."
69	"Have you heard the news?We're in a clean energy revolution.And where I live in Berkeley, California,it seems like every day I see a new roofwith new solar panels going up,electric car in the driveway.Germany sometimes getshalf its power from solar,and India is now committedto building 10 times more solarthan we have in California,by the year 2022. Even nuclear seems to bemaking a comeback.Bill Gates is in Chinaworking with engineers,there's 40 different companiesthat are working togetherto try to race to build the firstreactor that runs on waste,that can't melt downand is cheaper than coal.And so you might start to ask:Is this whole global warming problemgoing to be a lot easier to solvethan anybody imagined?That was the question we wanted to know,so my colleagues and I decidedto take a deep dive into the data.We were a little skeptical of some partsof the clean energy revolution story,but what we found really surprised us. The first thing is that cleanenergy has been increasing.This is electricity from clean energysources over the last 20 years.But when you look atthe percentage of global electricityfrom clean energy sources,it's actually been in declinefrom 36 percent to 31 percent.And if you care about climate change,you've got to go in the opposite directionto 100 percent of our electricityfrom clean energy sources,as quickly as possible.Now, you might wonder,\"Come on, how much could five percentagepoints of global electricity be?\"Well, it turns out to be quite a bit.It's the equivalent of 60 nuclear plantsthe size of Diablo Canyon,California's last nuclear plant,or 900 solar farms the size of Topaz,which is one of the biggestsolar farms in the world,and certainly our biggest in California.A big part of this is simplythat fossil fuels are increasingfaster than clean energy.And that's understandable.There's just a lot of poor countriesthat are still using woodand dung and charcoalas their main source of energy,and they need modern fuels. But there's something else going on,which is that one of those clean energysources in particularhas actually been on the declinein absolute terms,not just relatively.And that's nuclear.You can see its generationhas declined seven percentover the last 10 years.Now, solar and wind have beenmaking huge strides,so you hear a lot of talkabout how it doesn't really matter,because solar and windis going to make up the difference.But the data says something different.When you combine all the electricityfrom solar and wind,you see it actually barely makes uphalf of the decline from nuclear.Let's take a closer lookin the United States. Over the last couple of years —really 2013, 2014 —we prematurely retiredfour nuclear power plants.They were almost entirelyreplaced with fossil fuels,and so the consequencewas that we wiped outalmost as much clean energyelectricity that we get from solar.And it's not unique to us.People think of Californiaas a clean energy and climate leader,but when we looked at the data,what we found is that, in fact,California reduced emissions more slowlythan the national average,between 2000 and 2015. What about Germany?They're doing a lot of clean energy.But when you look at the data,German emissions have actuallybeen going up since 2009,and there's really not anybodywho's going to tell youthat they're going to meettheir climate commitments in 2020. The reason isn't hard to understand.Solar and wind provide powerabout 10 to 20 percent of the time,which means that whenthe sun's not shining,the wind's not blowing,you still need power for your hospitals,your homes, your cities, your factories.And while batteries have madesome really cool improvements lately,the truth is, they're just nevergoing to be as efficientas the electrical grid.Every time you put electricityinto a battery and take it out,you lose about 20 to 40percent of the power.That's why when, in California,we try to deal with all the solarwe've brought online —we now get about 10 percentof electricity from solar —when the sun goes down,and people come home from workand turn on their air conditionersand their TV sets,and every other appliance in the house,we need a lot of natural gas backup.So what we've been doingis stuffing a lot of natural gasinto the side of a mountain.And that worked pretty well for a while,but then late last year,it sprung a leak.This is Aliso Canyon.So much methane gas was released,it was the equivalent of puttinghalf a million cars on the road.It basically blew through allof our climate commitments for the year. Well, what about India?Sometimes you have to go placesto really get the right data,so we traveled to India a few months ago.We met with all the top officials —solar, nuclear, the rest —and what they told us is,\"We're actually havingmore serious problemsthan both Germany and California.We don't have backup;we don't have all the natural gas.And that's just the start of it.Say we want to getto 100 gigawatts by 2022.But last year we did just five,and the year before that, we did five.\"nSo, let's just takea closer look at nuclear.The United Nations IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Changehas looked at the carbon contentof all these different fuels,and nuclear comes out really low —it's actually lower even than solar.And nuclear obviouslyprovides a lot of power —24 hours a day, seven days a week.During a year, a single plant can providepower 92 percent of the time.What's interesting is thatwhen you look at countriesthat have deployed differentkinds of clean energies,there's only a few that have done soat a pace consistent with dealingwith the climate crisis. So nuclear seems likea pretty good option,but there's this big problem with it,which all of you, I'm sure, are aware of,which is that people really don't like it.There was a study, a survey doneof people around the world,not just in the United States or Europe,about a year and a half ago.And what they foundis that nuclear is actually oneof the least popular forms of energy.Even oil is more popular than nuclear.And while nuclear kind ofedges out coal, the thing is,people don't really fear coalin the same way they fear nuclear,which really operates on our unconscious. So what is it that we fear?There's really three things.There's the safetyof the plants themselves —the fears that they're goingto melt down and cause damage;there's the waste from them;and there's the association with weapons.And I think, understandably,engineers look at those concernsand look for technological fixes.That's why Bill Gates is in Chinadeveloping advanced reactors.That's why 40 different entrepreneursare working on this problem.And I, myself, have beenvery excited about it. We did a report:\"How to Make Nuclear Cheap.\"In particular, the thorium reactorshows a lot of promise.So when the climatescientist, James Hansen,asked if I wanted to go to China with himand look at the Chineseadvanced nuclear program,I jumped at the chance.We were there with MITand UC Berkeley engineers.And I had in my mindthat the Chinese would be ableto do with nuclearwhat they did with so many other things —start to crank out small nuclearreactors on assembly lines,ship them up like iPhones or MacBooksand send them around the world.I would get one at home in Berkeley.But what I found was somewhat different.The presentations were allvery exciting and very promising;they have multiple reactorsthat they're working on.The time came for the thorium reactor,and a bunch of us were excited.They went through the whole presentation,they got to the timeline,and they said,\"We're going to havea thorium molten salt reactorready for sale to the worldby 2040.\"And I was like, \"What?\"n(Laughter) I looked at my colleagues and I was like,\"Excuse me —can you guys speed that up a little bit?Because we're in a little bitof a climate crisis right now.And your cities are reallypolluted, by the way.\"And they responded back, they were like,\"I'm not sure what you've heardabout our thorium program,but we don't have a third of our budget,and your department of energyhasn't been particularly forthcomingwith all that data you guyshave on testing reactors.\"And I said, \"Well, I've got an idea.You know how you've got 10 yearswhere you're demonstrating that reactor?Let's just skip that part,and let's just go rightto commercializing it.That will save money and time.\"And the engineer justlooked at me and said,\"Let me ask you a question:Would you buy a car that had neverbeen demonstrated before?\"nSo what about the other reactors?There's a reactor that's coming onlinenow, they're starting to sell it.It's a high-temperature gas reactor.It can't melt down.But it's really big and bulky,that's part of the safety,and nobody thinksit's going to ever get cheaperthan the reactors that we have.The ones that use waste as fuelare really cool ideas, but the truth is,we don't actually know how to do that yet.There's some risk that you'llactually make more waste,and most people thinkthat if you're includingthat waste part of the process,it's just going to make the wholemachine a lot more expensive,it's just adding another complicated step. The truth is,there's real questions about how muchof that we're going to do.I mean, we went to India and askedabout the nuclear program.The government saidbefore the Paris climate talksthat they were going to do somethinglike 30 new nuclear plants.But when we got thereand interviewed peopleand even looked at the internal documents,they're now sayingthey're going to do about five.And in most of the world,especially the rich world,they're not talkingabout building new reactors.We're actually talkingabout taking reactors downbefore their lifetimes are over.Germany's actually pressuringits neighbors to do that.I mentioned the United States —we could lose half of our reactorsover the next 15 years,which would wipe out 40 percentof the emissions reductionswe're supposed to getunder the Clean Power Plan.Of course, in Japan, they tookall their nuclear plants offline,replaced them with coal,natural gas, oil burning,and they're only expected to bringonline about a third to two-thirds. So when we went through the numbers,and just added that up —how much nuclear do we seeChina and India bringing onlineover the next 15 years,how much do we see at riskof being taken offline —this was the most startling finding.What we found is thatthe world is actually at riskof losing four times more clean energythan we lost over the last 10 years.In other words: we're notin a clean energy revolution;we're in a clean energy crisis.So it's understandable that engineerswould look for a technical fixto the fears that people have of nuclear.But when you considerthat these are big challenges to do,that they're going to takea long time to solve,there's this other issue, which is:Are those technical fixesreally going to solve people's fears? Let's take safety.You know, despite what people think,it's hard to figure out howto make nuclear power much safer.I mean, every medicaljournal that looks at it —this is the most recent studyfrom the British journal, \"Lancet,\"one of the most respectedjournals in the world —nuclear is the safest wayto make reliable power.Everybody's scared of the accidents.So you go look at the accident data —Fukushima, Chernobyl —the World Health Organizationfinds the same thing:the vast majority of harmis caused by people panicking,and they're panickingbecause they're afraid.In other words,the harm that's causedisn't actually caused by the machinesor the radiation.It's caused by our fears. And what about the waste?Everyone worries about the waste.Well, the interestingthing about the wasteis how little of it there is.This is just from one plant.If you take all the nuclear wastewe've ever made in the United States,put it on a football field, stacked it up,it would only reach 20 feet high.And people say it's poisoningpeople or doing something —it's not, it's just sittingthere, it's just being monitored.There's not very much of it.By contrast, the waste that we don'tcontrol from energy production —we call it \"pollution,\" and it killsseven million people a year,and it's threatening very seriouslevels of global warming.And the truth is that even if we getgood at using that waste as fuel,there's always going to besome fuel left over.That means there's always going to bepeople that think it's a big problemfor reasons that maybe don't haveas much to do with the actual wasteas we think. Well, what about the weapons?Maybe the most surprising thingis that we can't find any examplesof countries that have nuclear powerand then, \"Oh!\" decide to go get a weapon.In fact, it works the opposite.What we find is the only way we knowhow to get rid large numbersof nuclear weaponsis by using the plutonium in the warheadsas fuel in our nuclear power plants.And so, if you are wanting to getthe world rid of nuclear weapons,then we're going to needa lot more nuclear power. (Applause) As I was leaving China,the engineer that brought Bill Gates therekind of pulled me aside,and he said, \"You know, Michael,I appreciate your interestin all the different nuclearsupply technologies,but there's this more basic issue,which is that there's just notenough global demand.I mean, we can crank outthese machines on assembly lines,we do know how to make things cheap,but there's just not enoughpeople that want them.\"nAnd so, let's do solar and windand efficiency and conservation.Let's accelerate the advancednuclear programs.I think we should triple the amountof money we're spending on it.But I just think the most important thing,if we're going to overcomethe climate crisis,is to keep in mind that the causeof the clean energy crisisisn't from within our machines,it's from within ourselves. Thank you very much. (Applause) \"We're not in a clean energy revolution; we're in a clean energy crisis,\" says climate policy expert Michael Shellenberger. His surprising solution: nuclear. In this passionate talk, he explains why it's time to overcome longstanding fears of the technology, and why he and other environmentalists believe it's past time to embrace nuclear as a viable and desirable source of clean power.

70	"The word concussion evokes a fearthese days more so than it ever has,and I know this personally.I played 10 years of football,was struck in the head thousands of times.And I have to tell you, though,what was much worse than thatwas a pair of bike accidents I hadwhere I suffered concussions,and I'm still dealing with the effectsof the most recent onetoday as I stand in front of you. There is a fear around concussionthat does have some evidence behind it.There is informationthat a repeated history of concussioncan lead to early dementia,such as Alzheimer's,and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.That was the subjectof the Will Smith movie \"Concussion.\"And so everybody is caught up in footballand what they see in the military,but you may not knowthat bike riding is the leading causeof concussion for kids,sports-related concussion, that is.And so another thingthat I should tell youthat you may not knowis that the helmets that are wornin bicycling and footballand many activities,they're not designed or testedfor how well they can protectyour children against concussion.They're in fact designed and testedfor their ability to protectagainst skull fracture. And so I get this questionall the time from parents,and they ask me,\"Would you let your own childplay football?\"Or, \"Should I let my child play soccer?\"And I think that as a field,we're a long way from giving an answerwith any kind of confidence there. So I look at that questionfrom a bit of a different lens,and I want to know,how can we prevent concussion?Is that even possible?And most experts think that it's not,but the work that we're doing in my labis starting to reveal moreof the details around concussionso that we can havea better understanding.The reason we're ableto prevent skull fracture with helmetsis because it's pretty simple.We know how it works.Concussion has beenmuch more of a mystery. So to give you a sense of what mightbe happening in a concussion,I want to show you the video herethat you see when you type into Google,\"What is a concussion?\"The CDC website comes up,and this video essentiallytells the whole story.What you see is the head moves forward,the brain lags behind,then the brain catches upand smashes into the skull.It rebounds off the skulland then proceeds to runinto the other side of the skull.And what you'll notice is highlightedin this video from the CDC,which I'll note was funded by the NFL,is that the outer surface of the brain,where it was to havesmashed into the skull,looks like it's been damaged or injured,so it's on the outer surface of the brain.And what I'd like to do with this videois to tell you that there aresome aspects that are probably right,indicative of what the scientiststhink happens with concussion,but there's probably morethat's wrong with this video. So one thing that I do agree with,and I think most experts would,is that the braindoes have these dynamics.It does lag behind the skulland then catch up and moveback and forth and oscillate.That we think is true.However, the amount of motionyou see in the brain in this videois probably not right at all.There's very little roomin the cranial vault,only a few millimeters,and it's filled entirelywith cerebral spinal fluid,which acts as a protective layer.And so the brain as a whole probablymoves very little inside the skull. The other problem with this videois that the brain is shownas a kind of rigid wholeas it moves around,and that's not true either.Your brain is one of the softestsubstances in your body,and you can think of itkind of like jello.So as your head is moving back and forth,your brain is twistingand turning and contorting,and the tissue is getting stretched.And so most experts, I think, would agreethat concussion is not likelyto be something that's happeningon this outer surface of the brain,but rather it's somethingthat's much deepertowards the center of the brain. Now, the way that we'reapproaching this problemto try to understandthe mechanisms of concussionand to figure out if we can prevent itis we are using a device like this.It's a mouthguard.It has sensors in itthat are essentially the samethat are in your cell phone:accelerometers, gyroscopes,and when someone is struck in the head,it can tell you how their head movedat a thousand samples per second.The principle behindthe mouthguard is this:it fits onto your teeth.Your teeth are one of the hardestsubstances in your body.So it rigidly couples to your skulland gives you the most precisepossible measurementof how the skull moves.People have triedother approaches, with helmets.We've looked at other sensorsthat go on your skin,and they all simply move around too much,and so we found that thisis the only reliable wayto take a good measurement. So now that we've got this device,we can go beyond studying cadavers,because you can onlylearn so much about concussionfrom studying a cadaver,and we want to learnand study live humans.So where can we finda group of willing volunteersto go out and smash their headsinto each other on a regular basisand sustain concussion?Well, I was one of them,and it's your local friendlyStanford football team. So this is our laboratory,and I want to show youthe first concussionwe measured with this device.One of the things that I should point outis the device has this gyroscope in it,and that allows youto measure the rotation of the head.Most experts thinkthat that's the critical factorthat might start to tell uswhat is happening in concussion.So please watch this video. Announcer: Cougars bringextra people late, but Luck has time,and Winslow is crushed.I hope he's all right. (Audience roars) Top of your screen,you'll see him come onjust this little post route,get separation, safety.Here it comes at you in real speed.You'll hear this.The hit delivered by —nDavid Camarillo: Sorry, three timesis probably a little excessive there.But you get the idea. So when you look at just the film here,pretty much the only thing you can seeis he got hit really hard and he was hurt.But when we extract the dataout of the mouthguard that he was wearing,we can see much more detail,much richer information.And one of the things that we noticed hereis that he was struckin the lower left side of his face mask.And so that did something firstthat was a little counterintuitive.His head did not move to the right.In fact, it rotated first to the left.Then as the neck began to compress,the force of the blow caused itto whip back to the right.So this left-right motionwas sort of a whiplash-type phenomenon,and we think that is probablywhat led to the brain injury. Now, this device is only limited in suchthat it can measure the skull motion,but what we really want to knowis what's happening inside of the brain.So we collaborate withSvein Kleiven's group in Sweden.They've developed a finite elementmodel of the brain.And so this is a simulationusing the data from our mouthguardfrom the injury I just showed you,and what you see is the brain —this is a cross-section right in the frontof the brain twistingand contorting as I mentioned.So you can see this doesn'tlook a lot like the CDC video.Now, the colors that you're looking atare how much the brain tissueis being stretched.And so the red is 50 percent.That means the brain has been stretchedto 50 percent of its original length,the tissue in that particular area. And the main thing I want to drawyour attention to is this red spot.So the red spot is very closeto the center of the brain,and relatively speaking,you don't see a lot of colors like thaton the exterior surfaceas the CDC video showed. Now, to explain a little more detailabout how we thinkconcussion might be happening,one thing I should mentionis that we and others have observedthat a concussion is more likelywhen you're struck and your headrotates in this direction.This is more commonin sports like football,but this seems to be more dangerous.So what might be happening there?Well, one thing that you'll noticein the human brainthat is different than other animalsis we have these two very large lobes.We have the right brainand the left brain.And the key thingto notice in this figure hereis that right down the centerof the right brain and the left brainthere's a large fissurethat goes deep into the brain.And in that fissure,what you can't see in this image,you'll have to trust me,there is a fibrous sheet of tissue.It's called the falx,and it runs from the front of your headall the way to the back of your head,and it's quite stiff.And so what that allows foris when you're struckand your head rotatesin this left-right direction,forces can rapidly transmitright down to the center of your brain. Now, what's thereat the bottom of this fissure?It's the wiring of your brain,and in fact this red bundlehere at the bottom of that fissureis the single largest fiber bundlethat is the wiring that connectsthe right and left sides of your brain.It's called the corpus callosum.And we think that this might beone of the most commonmechanisms of concussion,and as the forces move down,they strike the corpus callosum,it causes a dissociationbetween your right and your left brainand could explain someof the symptoms of concussion. This finding is also consistentof what we've seenin this brain disease that I mentioned,chronic traumatic encephalopathy.So this is an image of a middle-agedex-professional football player,and the thing that I want to point outis if you look at the corpus callosum,and I'll page back here so you can seethe size of a normal corpus callosumand the size of the person herewho has chronic traumatic encephalopathy,it is greatly atrophied.And the same goesfor all of the space in the ventricles.These ventricles are much larger.And so all of this tissuenear the center of the brainhas died off over time.So what we're learningis indeed consistent. Now, there is some good news here,and I hope to give you a senseof hope by the end of this talk.One of the things that we've noticed,specifically aboutthis mechanism of injury,is although there's a rapid transmissionof the forces down this fissure,it still takes a defined amount of time.And what we think is that if we canslow the head down just enoughso that the braindoes not lag behind the skullbut instead it movesin synchrony with the skull,then we might be able to preventthis mechanism of concussion. So how can we slow the head down? (Laughter) A gigantic helmet.So with more space, you have more time,and this is a bit of a joke,but some of you may have seen this.This is bubble soccer,and it's a real sport.In fact, I saw some young adultsplaying this sport down the streetfrom my house the other day,and as far as I knowthere have been no reported concussions. (Laughter) But in all seriousness,this principle does work,but this has gone too far.This isn't something that's practicalfor bike riding or playing football.And so we are collaboratingwith a company in Sweden called Hövding.Some of you may have seen their work,and they're using the same principleof air to give you some extra spaceto prevent concussion.Kids, don't try this at home please.This stuntman does not have a helmet.He instead has a neck collar,and this neck collar has sensors in it,the same type of sensorsthat are in our mouthguard,and it detects when he's likelyto have a fall,and there's an airbagthat explodes and triggers,the same way that an airbagworks in your car, essentially.And in the experimentswe've done in my lab with their device,we found that it can greatly reducethe risk of concussion in some scenarioscompared to a normal bicycle helmet.So it's a pretty exciting development. But in order for us to actually realizethe benefits of technologythat can prevent concussion,it needs to meet regulations.That's a reality.And this device is for sale in Europebut is not for sale in the US,and probably won't be any time soon.So I wanted to tell you why.There are some good reasons and thenthere are some not so good reasons. Bike helmets are federally regulated.The Consumer Product Safety Commissionhas been given jurisdictionto approve any bike helmet for sale,and this is the test they use.This is back to what I was telling youat the beginning about skull fracture.That's what this test is for.And that's an important thing to do.It can save your life,but it's not sufficient, I would say.So for example, one thingthis test doesn't evaluateis it doesn't tell youis that airbag going to triggerat the right time and place,and not trigger when it doesn't need to?Similarly, it's not going to tell youis this helmet likelyto prevent concussion or not?And if you look at football helmets,which aren't regulated,they still have a very similar test.They're not regulatedby the government, anyway.They have an industry body,which is the way most industries work.But this industry body, I can tell you,has been quite resistantto updating their standards.So in my lab, we are working on not onlythe mechanism of concussion,but we want to understandhow can we have better test standards?And we hope that the governmentcan use this type of informationto encourage innovationby letting consumers knowhow protected are you with a given helmet. And I want to bring this back finallyto the original question I asked,which is, would I feel comfortableletting my child play footballor ride a bicycle?And this might be just a resultof my own traumatic experience.I'm much more nervousabout my daughter, Rose, riding a bicycle.So she's a year and a half old,and she's already, well, wants to anyway,race down the streets of San Francisco.This is the bottomof one of these streets.And so my personal goalis to — and I believe this is possible —is to further develop these technologies,and in fact, we're workingon something in my lab in particularthat really makes optimal useof the given space of a helmet.And I am confidentthat we will be able to,before she's ready to ride a two-wheeler,have something availablethat can in fact really reducethe risk of concussionand comply with regulatory bodies. And so what I'd like to do —and I know that this is for some of youof more immediate nature,I've got a couple years here —is to be able to tell parentsand grandparents when I'm asked,it is safe and healthy for your childrento engage in these activities.And I'm very fortunateto have a wonderful team at Stanfordthat's working hard on this. So I hope to come back in a few yearswith the final story,but for now I will tell you,please don't just be afraidwhen you hear the word concussion.There is hope. Thank you. (Applause) What is a concussion? Probably not what you think it is. In this talk from the cutting edge of research, bioengineer (and former football player) David Camarillo shows what really happens during a concussion — and why standard sports helmets don't prevent it. Here's what the future of concussion prevention looks like. David Camarillo's research focuses on understanding and preventing traumatic brain injury.

71	"The technology likely to havethe greatest impacton the next few decadeshas arrived.And it's not social media.It's not big data.It's not robotics.It's not even AI.You'll be surprised to learnthat it's the underlying technologyof digital currencies like Bitcoin.It's called the blockchain. Blockchain. Now, it's not the most sonorousword in the world,but I believe that this is nowthe next generation of the internet,and that it holds vast promisefor every business, every societyand for all of you, individually. You know, for the past few decades,we've had the internet of information.And when I send you an emailor a PowerPoint file or something,I'm actually not sending you the original,I'm sending you a copy.And that's great.This is democratized information.But when it comes to assets —things like money,financial assets like stocks and bonds,loyalty points, intellectual property,music, art, a vote,carbon credit and other assets —sending you a copy is a really bad idea.If I send you 100 dollars,it's really importantthat I don't still have the money —n(Laughter) and that I can't send it to you.This has been calledthe \"double-spend\" problemby cryptographers for a long time. So today, we rely entirelyon big intermediaries —middlemen like banks, government,big social media companies,credit card companies and so on —to establish trust in our economy.And these intermediaries performall the business and transaction logicof every kind of commerce,from authentication,identification of people,through to clearing, settlingand record keeping.And overall, they do a pretty good job.But there are growing problems. To begin, they're centralized.That means they can be hacked,and increasingly are —JP Morgan, the US Federal Government,LinkedIn, Home Depot and othersfound that out the hard way.They exclude billions of peoplefrom the global economy,for example, peoplewho don't have enough moneyto have a bank account.They slow things down.It can take a second for an emailto go around the world,but it can take days or weeksfor money to move throughthe banking system across a city.And they take a big piece of the action —10 to 20 percent just to send moneyto another country.They capture our data,and that means we can't monetize itor use it to better manage our lives.Our privacy is being undermined.And the biggest problem is that overall,they've appropriated the largesseof the digital age asymmetrically:we have wealth creation,but we have growing social inequality. So what if there were not onlyan internet of information,what if there were an internet of value —some kind of vast, global,distributed ledgerrunning on millions of computersand available to everybody.And where every kind of asset,from money to music,could be stored, moved, transacted,exchanged and managed,all without powerful intermediaries?What if there werea native medium for value? Well, in 2008, the financialindustry crashedand, perhaps propitiously,an anonymous person or personsnamed Satoshi Nakamotocreated a paper where he developeda protocol for a digital cashthat used an underlyingcryptocurrency called Bitcoin.And this cryptocurrency enabled peopleto establish trust and do transactionswithout a third party.And this seemingly simple actset off a sparkthat ignited the world,that has everyone excitedor terrified or otherwise interestedin many places.Now, don't be confused about Bitcoin —Bitcoin is an asset; it goes up and down,and that should be of interestto you if you're a speculator.More broadly, it's a cryptocurrency.It's not a fiat currencycontrolled by a nation-state.And that's of greater interest.But the real pony hereis the underlying technology.It's called blockchain. So for the first time nowin human history,people everywhere can trust each otherand transact peer to peer.And trust is established,not by some big institution,but by collaboration, by cryptographyand by some clever code.And because trust is nativeto the technology,I call this, \"The Trust Protocol.\"nNow, you're probably wondering:How does this thing work?Fair enough.Assets — digital assets like moneyto music and everything in between —are not stored in a central place,but they're distributedacross a global ledger,using the highest level of cryptography.And when a transaction is conducted,it's posted globally,across millions and millions of computers.And out there, around the world,is a group of people called \"miners.\"These are not young people,they're Bitcoin miners.They have massive computing powerat their fingertips —10 to 100 times biggerthan all of Google worldwide.These miners do a lot of work.And every 10 minutes,kind of like the heartbeat of a network,a block gets createdthat has all the transactionsfrom the previous 10 minutes.Then the miners get to work,trying to solve some tough problems. And they compete:the first miner to find out the truthand to validate the block,is rewarded in digital currency,in the case of the Bitcoinblockchain, with Bitcoin.And then — this is the key part —that block is linked to the previous blockand the previous blockto create a chain of blocks.And every one is time-stamped,kind of like with a digital waxed seal.So if I wanted to go and hack a blockand, say, pay you and youwith the same money,I'd have to hack that block,plus all the preceding blocks,the entire history of commerceon that blockchain,not just on one computerbut across millions of computers,simultaneously,all using the highestlevels of encryption,in the light of the most powerfulcomputing resource in the worldthat's watching me.Tough to do.This is infinitely more securethan the computer systemsthat we have today.Blockchain. That's how it works. So the Bitcoin blockchain is just one.There are many.The Ethereum blockchain was developedby a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin.He's [22] years old,and this blockchainhas some extraordinary capabilities.One of them is that you canbuild smart contracts.It's kind of what it sounds like.It's a contract that self-executes,and the contract handles the enforcement,the management, performanceand payment — the contract kind of hasa bank account, too, in a sense —of agreements between people.And today, on the Ethereum blockchain,there are projects underwayto do everythingfrom create a new replacementfor the stock marketto create a new model of democracy,where politiciansare accountable to citizens. (Applause) So to understand what a radical changethis is going to bring,let's look at one industry,financial services.Recognize this?Rube Goldberg machine.It's a ridiculously complicated machinethat does something really simple,like crack an egg or shut a door.Well, it kind of reminds meof the financial services industry,honestly.I mean, you tap your cardin the corner store,and a bitstream goes througha dozen companies,each with their own computer system,some of them being 1970s mainframesolder than manyof the people in this room,and three days later, a settlement occurs.Well, with a blockchainfinancial industry,there would be no settlement,because the payment and the settlementis the same activity,it's just a change in the ledger.So Wall Street and all around the world,the financial industryis in a big upheaval about this,wondering, can we be replaced,or how do we embracethis technology for success? Now, why should you care?Well, let me describe some applications.Prosperity.The first era of the internet,the internet of information,brought us wealthbut not shared prosperity,because social inequality is growing.And this is at the heartof all of the anger and extremismand protectionism and xenophobia and worsethat we're seeing growingin the world today,Brexit being the most recent case. So could we develop some new approachesto this problem of inequality?Because the only approach todayis to redistribute wealth,tax people and spread it around more.Could we pre-distribute wealth?Could we change the way that wealthgets created in the first placeby democratizing wealth creation,engaging more people in the economy,and then ensuring that they gotfair compensation?Let me describe five waysthat this can be done. Number one:Did you know that 70 percentof the people in the world who have landhave a tenuous title to it?So, you've got a little farm in Honduras,some dictator comes to power,he says, \"I know you've got a pieceof paper that says you own your farm,but the government computersays my friend owns your farm.\"This happened on a mass scale in Honduras,and this problem exists everywhere.Hernando de Soto, the greatLatin American economist,says this is the number oneissue in the worldin terms of economic mobility,more important than having a bank account,because if you don't havea valid title to your land,you can't borrow against it,and you can't plan for the future. So today, companiesare working with governmentsto put land titles on a blockchain.And once it's there, this is immutable.You can't hack it.This creates the conditions for prosperityfor potentially billions of people. Secondly:a lot of writers talk about Uberand Airbnb and TaskRabbitand Lyft and so onas part of the sharing economy.This is a very powerful idea,that peers can come togetherand create and share wealth.My view is that ...these companies are not really sharing.In fact, they're successfulprecisely because they don't share.They aggregate services together,and they sell them.What if, rather than Airbnbbeing a $25 billion corporation,there was a distributed applicationon a blockchain, we'll call it B-Airbnb,and it was essentially ownedby all of the peoplewho have a room to rent.And when someone wants to rent a room,they go onto the blockchaindatabase and all the criteria,they sift through, it helpsthem find the right room,and then the blockchain helpswith the contracting,it identifies the party,it handles the paymentsjust through digital payments —they're built into the system.And it even handles reputation,because if she rates a roomas a five-star room,that room is there,and it's rated, and it's immutable.So, the big sharing-economydisruptors in Silicon Valleycould be disrupted,and this would be good for prosperity. Number three:the biggest flow of fundsfrom the developed worldto the developing worldis not corporate investment,and it's not even foreign aid.It's remittances.This is the global diaspora;people have left their ancestral lands,and they're sending money backto their families at home.This is 600 billion dollars a year,and it's growing,and these people are getting ripped off. Analie Domingo is a housekeeper.She lives in Toronto,and every month she goesto the Western Union officewith some cashto send her remittancesto her mom in Manila.It costs her around 10 percent;the money takes four to sevendays to get there;her mom never knowswhen it's going to arrive.It takes five hoursout of her week to do this. Six months ago,Analie Domingo useda blockchain application called Abra.And from her mobile device,she sent 300 bucks.It went directlyto her mom's mobile devicewithout going through an intermediary.And then her momlooked at her mobile device —it's kind of like an Uber interface,there's Abra \"tellers\" moving around.She clicks on a tellerthat's a five-star teller,who's seven minutes away.The guy shows up at the door,gives her Filipino pesos,she puts them in her wallet.The whole thing took minutes,and it cost her two percent.This is a big opportunity for prosperity. Number four: the most powerful assetof the digital age is data.And data is really a new asset class,maybe bigger than previous asset classes,like land under the agrarian economy,or an industrial plant,or even money.And all of you — we — create this data.We create this asset,and we leave this trailof digital crumbs behind usas we go throughout life.And these crumbs are collectedinto a mirror image of you,the virtual you.And the virtual you may knowmore about you than you do,because you can't rememberwhat you bought a year ago,or said a year ago,or your exact location a year ago.And the virtual you is not owned by you —that's the big problem. So today, there are companies workingto create an identity in a black box,the virtual you owned by you.And this black box moves around with youas you travel throughout the world,and it's very, very stingy.It only gives awaythe shred of informationthat's required to do something.A lot of transactions,the seller doesn't even needto know who you are.They just need to know that they got paid. And then this avataris sweeping up all of this dataand enabling you to monetize it.And this is a wonderful thing,because it can also help usprotect our privacy,and privacy is the foundationof a free society.Let's get this asset that we createback under our control,where we can own our own identityand manage it responsibly. Finally —n(Applause) Finally, number five:there are a whole numberof creators of contentwho don't receive fair compensation,because the systemfor intellectual property is broken.It was broken by the first eraof the internet.Take music.Musicians are left with crumbsat the end of the whole food chain.You know, if you were a songwriter,25 years ago, you wrote a hit song,it got a million singles,you could get royaltiesof around 45,000 dollars.Today, you're a songwriter,you write a hit song,it gets a million streams,you don't get 45k,you get 36 dollars,enough to buy a nice pizza. So Imogen Heap,the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter,is now putting musicon a blockchain ecosystem.She calls it \"Mycelia.\"And the music hasa smart contract surrounding it.And the music protectsher intellectual property rights.You want to listen to the song?It's free, or maybe a few micro-centsthat flow into a digital account.You want to put the songin your movie, that's different,and the IP rights are all specified.You want to make a ringtone?That's different.She describes that the songbecomes a business.It's out there on this platformmarketing itself,protecting the rights of the author,and because the song has a payment systemin the sense of bank account,all the money flows back to the artist,and they control the industry,rather than these powerful intermediaries.Now, this is —n(Applause) This is not just songwriters,it's any creator of content,like art,like inventions,scientific discoveries, journalists.There are all kinds of peoplewho don't get fair compensation,and with blockchains,they're going to be ableto make it rain on the blockchain.And that's a wonderful thing. So, these are five opportunitiesout of a dozento solve one problem, prosperity,which is one of countless problemsthat blockchains are applicable to. Now, technology doesn't createprosperity, of course — people do.But my case to you is that, once again,the technology geniehas escaped from the bottle,and it was summonedby an unknown person or personsat this uncertain time in human history,and it's giving usanother kick at the can,another opportunity to rewritethe economic power gridand the old order of things,and solve some of the world's mostdifficult problems,if we will it. Thank you. (Applause) What is the blockchain? If you don't know, you should; if you do, chances are you still need some clarification on how it actually works. Don Tapscott is here to help, demystifying this world-changing, trust-building technology which, he says, represents nothing less than the second generation of the internet and holds the potential to transform money, business, government and society. Don Tapscott takes the long view on our digital, connected, hyper-collaborative world. Don Tapscott takes the long view on our digital, connected, hyper-collaborative world."
72	"Guys, we have an issue. (Laughter) Growth is fading away,and it's a big deal.Our global economy stops growing.And it's not new.Growth has actually declinedfor the last 50 years.If we continue like this, we need to learnhow to live in a worldwith no growth in the next decade.This is scary becausewhen the economy doesn't grow,our children don't get better lives.What's even scarier is thatwhen the pie does not grow,each of us get a smaller piece.We're then ready to fightfor a bigger one.This creates tensionsand serious conflicts.Growth matters a lot. If we look at the history of growth,times of big growthhave always been fueledby big manufacturing revolutions.It happened three times,every 50-60 years.The steam enginein the middle of the 19th century,the mass-production modelin the beginning of the 20th century —thanks, Mr. Ford.And the first automationwave in the 1970s. Why did these manufacturing revolutionscreate huge growth in our economies?Because they have injectedhuge productivity improvement.It's rather simple:in order to grow,you need to be producing more,putting more into our economy.This means either more laboror more capital or more productivity.Each time, productivityhas been the growth lever. I'm here today to tell youthat we are on the vergeof another huge change,and that this change, surprisingly enough,is going to comefrom manufacturing, again.It will get us out of our growth slumpand it will change radicallythe way globalization has been shapedover the last decade.I'm here to tell you about the amazingfourth manufacturing revolutionthat is currently underway. It's not as if we've done nothingwith manufacturingsince the last revolution.Actually, we've madesome pretty lame attemptsto try to revitalize it.But none of themhave been the big overhaulwe really need to get us growing again.For example, we've triedto relocate our factories offshorein order to reduce costand take advantage of cheap labor.Not only did this notinspire productivity,but it only saved moneyfor a short period of time,because cheap labordidn't stay cheap for long.Then, we've tried to makeour factories largerand we specialized them by product.The idea was that we canmake a lot of one productand stockpile it to be sold with demand. This did help productivity for a while.But it introduced a lot of rigiditiesin our supply chain.Let's take fashion retail.Traditional clothing companieshave built offshore,global, rigid supply chains.When fast-fashion competitors like Zarastarted replenishing their stocks fasterfrom two collections a yearto one collection a month,none of them have been ableto keep up with the pace.Most of them arein great difficulties today. Yet, with all of their shortcomings,those are the factories we know today.When you open the doors,they look the sameas they did 50 years ago.We've just changed the location,the size, the way they operate.Can you name anything elsethat looks the sameas it did 50 years ago?It's crazy.We've made all the tweaksto the model that we could,and now we hit its limits. After all of our attempts to fixthe manufacturing model failed,we thought growth could comefrom elsewhere.We turned to the tech sector —there's been quite a lotof innovations there.Just to name one: the Internet.We hoped it could produce growth.And indeed, it changed our lives.It made big waves in the media,the service, the entertainment spaces.But it hasn't done much for productivity.Actually, what's surprisingis that productivity is on the declinedespite all of those innovation efforts.Imagine that — sitting at work,scrolling through Facebook,watching videos on YouTubehas made us less productive.Weird. (Laughter) This is why we are not growing.We failed at reinventingthe manufacturing space,and large technological innovationshave played away from it.But what if we could combine those forces?What if the existing manufacturingand large technological innovationcame together to createthe next big manufacturing reinvention. Bingo!This is the fourthmanufacturing revolution,and it's happening right now.Major technologies are enteringthe manufacturing space,big time.They will boost industrial productivityby more than a third.This is massive, and it will doa lot in creating growth.Let me tell you about some of them. Have you already met advancedmanufacturing robots?They are the size of humans,they actually collaborate with them,and they can be programmedin order to performcomplex, non-repetitive tasks.Today in our factories, only8 percent of the tasks are automated.The less complex,the more repetitive ones.It will be 25 percent in 10 years.It means that by 2025,advanced robots will complement workersto be, together,20 percent more productive,to manufacture 20 percent more outputs,to achieve 20 percent additional growth. This isn't some fancy, futuristic idea.These robots are working for us right now.Last year in the US, they helpedAmazon prepare and ship all the productsrequired for Cyber Monday,the annual peak of online retail.Last year in the US,it was the biggest online shopping dayof the year and of history.Consumers spent 3 billion dollarson electronics that day.That's real economic growth. Then there's additivemanufacturing, 3D printing.3D printing has already improvedplastic manufacturingand it's now making its way through metal.Those are not small industries.Plastic and metals represent 25 percentof global manufacturing production. Let's take a real example.In the aerospace industry,fuel nozzles are some of the mostcomplex parts to manufacture,for one reason:they are made up of 20 different partsthat need to be separately producedand then painstakingly assembled.Aerospace companiesare now using 3D printing,which allows them to turnthose 20 different partsinto just one.The results?40 percent more productivity,40 percent more output produced,40 percent more growthfor this specific industry. But actually, the most exciting partof this new manufacturing revolutiongoes much beyond productivity.It's about producing better,smarter products.It's about scale customization.Imagine a world where you can buythe exact products you wantwith the functionalities you need,with the design you want,with the same cost and lead timeas a product that's been mass produced,like your car, or your clothesor your cell phone.The new manufacturing revolutionmakes it possible. Advanced robots can be programmedin order to performany product configurationwithout any setup time or ramp up.3D printers instantaneously produceany customized design.We are now able to producea batch of one product, your product,at the same cost and lead timeas a batch of many.Those are only a few examplesof the manufacturing revolution at play. Not only will manufacturingbecome more productive,it will also become more flexible,and those were exactly the elementsof growth that we are missing.But actually, there are evensome bigger implicationsfor all of us when manufacturingwill find its way back into the limelight.It will create a huge macroeconomic shift. First, our factories will be relocatedinto our home markets.In the world of scale customization,consumer proximity is the new norm. Then, our factorieswill be smaller, agile.Scale does not matter anymore,flexibility does.They will be operating on a multi-product,made-to-order basis.The change will be drastic. Globalization will enter a new era.The East-to-West trade flowswill be replaced by regional trade flows.East for East, West for West.When you think about that,the old model was pretty much insane.Piling up stocks, making productstravel the whole worldbefore they reach their end consumers.The new model, producingjust next to the consumer market,will be much cleaner,much better for our environment.In mature economies,manufacturing will be back home,creating more employment,more productivity and more growth.Good news, isn't it? But here's the thing with growth —it does not come automatically.Mature economies will have to seize it.We'll have to massivelyre-train our workforce.In most countries,like in my country, France,we've told our childrenthat manufacturing had no future.That it was something happening far away.We need to reverse thatand teach manufacturing againat university.Only the countriesthat will boldly transformwill be able to seize this growth. It's also a chancefor developing economies.Of course Chinaand other emerging economieswon't be the factory of the world anymore.Actually, it was not a sustainablemodel in the long term,as those countries are becoming richer.Last year, it was alreadyas expensive to produce in Brazilas to produce in France.By 2018, manufacturing costs in Chinawill be on par with the US. The new manufacturing revolutionwill accelerate the transitionof those emerging economiestowards a model drivenby domestic consumption.And this is good,because this is where growthwill be created.In the next five years,the next billion consumers in Chinawill inject more growth in our economiesthan the top fiveEuropean markets together. This fourth manufacturing revolutionis a chance for all of us.If we play it right,we'll see sustainable growthin all of our economies.This means more wealthdistributed to all of usand a better future for our children. Thank you. (Applause) Economic growth has been slowing for the past 50 years, but relief might come from an unexpected place — a new form of manufacturing that is neither what you thought it was nor where you thought it was. Industrial systems thinker Olivier Scalabre details how a fourth manufacturing revolution will produce a macroeconomic shift and boost employment, productivity and growth.

73	"In July of 1911,a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professorset out from his rainforest campwith his team.After climbing a steep hilland wiping the sweat from his brow,he described what he saw beneath him.He saw rising fromthe dense rainforest foliagethis incredible interlockingmaze of structuresbuilt of granite,beautifully put together. What's amazing about this projectis that it was the first fundedby National Geographic,and it graced the front coverof its magazine in 1912.This professor used state-of-the-artphotography equipmentto record the site,forever changing the face of exploration. The site was Machu Picchu,discovered and explored by Hiram Bingham.When he saw the site, he asked,\"This is an impossible dream.What could it be?\"nSo today,100 years later,I invite you allon an incredible journey with me,a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor. (Cheers) We will do nothing lessthan use state-of-the-art technologyto map an entire country.This is a dream started by Hiram Bingham,but we are expanding it to the world,making archaeological explorationmore open, inclusive,and at a scale simplynot previously possible. This is why I am so excitedto share with you all todaythat we will beginthe 2016 TED Prize platformin Latin America,more specifically Peru. (Applause) Thank you. We will be takingHiram Bingham's impossible dreamand turning it into an amazing futurethat we can all share in together. So Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu.It has absolutely stunning jewelry,like what you can see here.It has amazing Moche potteryof human figures.It has the Nazca Linesand amazing textiles.So as part of the TED Prize platform,we are going to partneringwith some incredible organizations,first of all with DigitalGlobe,the world's largest providerof high-resolutioncommercial satellite imagery.They're going to be helping us build outthis amazing crowdsourcingplatform they have.Maybe some of you used itwith the MH370 crashand search for the airplane.Of course, they'll also be providing uswith the satellite imagery.National Geographic will be helping uswith education and of course exploration.As well, they'll be providing uswith rich content for the platform,including some of the archival imagerylike you saw at the beginning of this talkand some of their documentary footage.We've already begunto build and plan the platform,and I'm just so excited. So here's the cool part.My team, headed up by Chase Childs,is already beginning to lookat some of the satellite imagery.Of course, what you can see hereis 0.3-meter data.This is site called Chan Chanin northern Peru.It dates to 850 AD.It's a really amazing city,but let's zoom in.This is the type and quality of datathat you all will get to see.You can see individual structures,individual buildings.And we've already begunto find previously unknown sites.What we can say alreadyis that as part of the platform,you will all help discoverthousands of previously unknown sites,like this one here,and this potentially large one here.Unfortunately, we've also begunto uncover large-scale looting at sites,like what you see here.So many sites in Peru are threatened,but the great partis that all of this datais going to be sharedwith archaeologists on the front linesof protecting these sites. So I was just in Peru,meeting with their Minister of Cultureas well as UNESCO.We'll be collaborating closely with them.Just so you all know,the site is going to bein both English and Spanish,which is absolutely essential to make surethat people in Peru and acrossLatin America can participate.Our main project coprincipal investigatoris the gentleman you see here,Dr. Luis Jaime Castillo,professor at Catholic University.As a respected Peruvian archaeologistand former vice-minister,Dr. Castillo will be helping us coordinateand share the data with archaeologistsso they can explorethese sites on the ground.He also runs this amazingdrone mapping program,some of the images of whichyou can see behind me here and here.And this data will be incorporatedinto the platform,and also he'll be helping to imagesome of the new sites you help find. Our on-the-ground partnerwho will be helping uswith education, outreach,as well as site preservation components,is the SustainablePreservation Initiative,led by Dr. Larry Coben.Some of you may not be awarethat some of the world'spoorest communitiescoexist with some of the world'smost well-known archaeological sites.What SPI doesis it helps to empower these communities,in particular women,with new economic approachesand business training.So it helps to teach themto create beautiful handicraftswhich are then sold on to tourists.This empowers the womento treasure their cultural heritageand take ownership of it.I had the opportunity to spend some timewith 24 of these womenat a well-known archaeological sitecalled Pachacamac, just outside Lima.These women were unbelievably inspiring,and what's great is that SPIwill help us transform communitiesnear some of the sitesthat you help to discover. Peru is just the beginning.We're going to be expandingthis platform to the world,but already I've gottenthousands of emailsfrom people all across the world —professors, educators, students,and other archaeologists —who are so excited to help participate.In fact, they're already suggestingamazing places for us to help discover,including Atlantis.I don't know if we're goingto be looking for Atlantis,but you never know. So I'm just so excitedto launch this platform.It's going to be launched formallyby the end of the year.And I have to say,if what my team has already discoveredin the past few weeks are any indication,what the world discoversis just going to be beyond imagination.Make sure to hold on to your alpacas. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Around the world, hundreds of thousands of lost ancient sites lie buried and hidden from view. Satellite archaeologist Sarah Parcak is determined to find them before looters do. With the 2016 TED Prize, Parcak is building an online citizen-science tool called GlobalXplorer that will train an army of volunteer explorers to find and protect the world's hidden heritage. In this talk, she offers a preview of the first place they'll look: Peru — the home of Machu Picchu, the Nazca lines and other archaeological wonders waiting to be discovered. Like a modern-day Indiana Jones, Sarah Parcak uses satellite images to locate lost ancient sites. The winner of the 2016 TED Prize, her wish is to protect the world’s shared cultural heritage.

74	"Is there life beyond Earthin our solar system? Wow, what a powerful question.You know, as a scientist —planetary scientist —we really didn't take thatvery seriously until recently. Carl Sagan always said,\"It takes extraordinary evidencefor extraordinary claims.\"And the claims of having life beyond Earthneed to be definitive,they need to be loudand they need to be everywherefor us to be able to believe it. So how do we make this journey?What we decided to dois first look forthose ingredients for life.The ingredients of life are:liquid water —we have to have a solvent,can't be ice, has to be liquid.We also have to have energy.We also have to have organic material —things that make us up,but also things that we need to consume. So we have to have these elementsin environments for long periods of timefor us to be ableto be confident that life,in that moment when it starts,can spark and then grow and evolve. Well, I have to tell youthat early in my career,when we looked at those three elements,I didn't believethat they were beyond Earthin any length of timeand for any real quantity. Why? We look at the inner planets.Venus is way too hot — it's got no water.Mars — dry and arid.It's got no water.And beyond Mars,the water in the solar systemis all frozen. But recent observationshave changed all that.It's now turning our attentionto the right placesfor us to take a deeper lookand really start to answerour life question. So when we look out into the solar system,where are the possibilities?We're concentrating our attentionon four locations.The planet Marsand then three moons of the outer planets:Titan, Europa and small Enceladus. So what about Mars?Let's go through the evidence.Well, Mars we thoughtwas initially moon-like:full of craters, arid and a dead world. And so about 15 years ago,we started a seriesof missions to go to Marsand see if water existedon Mars in its pastthat changed its geology.We ought to be able to notice that.And indeed we startedto be surprised right away.Our higher resolution imagesshow deltas and river valleys and gulleysthat were there in the past.And in fact,Curiosity —which has been roving on the surfacenow for about three years —has really shown us that it's sittingin an ancient river bed,where water flowed rapidly.And not for a little while,perhaps hundreds of millions of years.And if everything was there,including organics,perhaps life had started. Curiosity has alsodrilled in that red soiland brought up other material.And we were really excitedwhen we saw that.Because it wasn't red Mars,it was gray material,it's gray Mars.We brought it into the rover,we tasted it,and guess what?We tasted organics —carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur —they were all there. So Mars in its past,with a lot of water,perhaps plenty of time,could have had life,could have had that spark,could have grown.And is that life still there?We don't know that. But a few years agowe started to look at a number of craters.During the summer,dark lines would appeardown the sides of these craters.The more we looked,the more craters we saw,the more of these features.We now know more than a dozen of them. A few months ago the fairy tale came true.We announced to the worldthat we know what these streaks are.It's liquid water.These craters are weepingduring the summer.Liquid water is flowingdown these craters.So what are we going to do now —now that we see the water?Well, it tells us that Mars hasall the ingredients necessary for life.In its past it had perhapstwo-thirds of its northern hemisphere —there was an ocean.It has weeping water right now.Liquid water on its surface.It has organics.It has all the right conditions. So what are we going to do next?We're going to launch a series of missionsto begin that search for life on Mars.And now it's more appealingthan ever before. As we move out into the solar system,here's the tiny moon Enceladus.This is not in what we callthe traditional habitable zone,this area around the sun.This is much further out.This object should beice over a silicate core. But what did we find?Cassini was there since 2006,and after a couple yearslooked back after it flew by Enceladusand surprised us all.Enceladus is blasting sheets of waterout into the solar systemand sloshing back down onto the moon.What a fabulous environment.Cassini just a few months agoalso flew through the plume,and it measured silicate particles.Where does the silica come from?It must come from the ocean floor.The tidal energy is generated by Saturn,pulling and squeezing this moon —is melting that ice,creating an ocean.But it's also doing that to the core. Now, the only thing that we can think ofthat does that here on Earthas an analogy ...are hydrothermal vents.Hydrothermal vents deep in our oceanwere discovered in 1977.Oceanographers were completely surprised.And now there are thousandsof these below the ocean. What do we find?The oceanographers, when they goand look at these hydrothermal vents,they're teeming with life,regardless of whether the wateris acidic or alkaline —doesn't matter.So hydrothermal vents area fabulous abode for life here on Earth. So what about Enceladus?Well, we believe because it has waterand has had it fora significant period of time,and we believe it has hydrothermal ventswith perhaps the right organic material,it is a place where life could exist.And not just microbial —maybe more complexbecause it's had time to evolve. Another moon, very similar,is Europa.Galileo visited Jupiter's system in 1996and made fabulous observations of Europa.Europa, we also know,has an under-the-ice crust ocean.Galileo mission told us that,but we never saw any plumes.But we didn't look for them. Hubble,just a couple years ago,observing Europa,saw plumes of waterspraying from the cracksin the southern hemisphere,just exactly like Enceladus. These moons,which are not in what we calla traditional habitable zone,that are out in the solar system,have liquid water.And if there are organics there,there may be life. This is a fabulous set of discoveriesbecause these moonshave been in this environment like thatfor billions of years.Life started here on Earth, we believe,after about the first 500 million,and look where we are.These moons are fabulous moons. Another moon that we'relooking at is Titan.Titan is a huge moon of Saturn.It perhaps is much largerthan the planet Mercury.It has an extensive atmosphere.It's so extensive —and it's mostly nitrogenwith a little methane and ethane —that you have to peerthrough it with radar. And on the surface,Cassini has found liquid.We see lakes ...actually almost the sizeof our Black Sea in some places.And this area is not liquid water;it's methane.If there's any place in the solar systemwhere life is not like us,where the substitute of wateris another solvent —and it could be methane —it could be Titan. Well, is there life beyond Earthin the solar system?We don't know yet,but we're hot on the pursuit.The data that we're receivingis really excitingand telling us —forcing us to think about thisin new and exciting ways.I believe we're on the right track.That in the next 10 years,we will answer that question.And if we answer it,and it's positive,then life is everywherein the solar system.Just think about that.We may not be alone. Thank you. (Applause) Is there life beyond Earth? Join NASA's director of planetary science James Green for a survey of the places in our solar system that are most likely to harbor alien life.

75	"How do we build a societywithout fossil fuels? This is a very complex challenge,and I believe developing countriescould take the lead in this transition.And I'm aware that thisis a contentious statement,but the reality is that so muchis at stake in our countriesif we let fossil fuels stayat the center of our development.We can do it differently.And it's time, it really is time,to debunk the myththat a country has to choosebetween development on the one handand environmental protection,renewables, quality of life, on the other. I come from Costa Rica,a developing country.We are nearly five million people,and we live right in the middleof the Americas,so it's very easyto remember where we live.Nearly 100 percent of our electricitycomes from renewable sources,five of them. (Applause) Hydropower, geothermal,wind, solar, biomass. Did you know that last year,for 299 days,we did not use any fossil fuelsin order to generate all our electricity?It's a fantastic achievement,and yet, it hides a paradox,which is that nearly 70 percentof all our energy consumption is oil. Why?Because of our transportation system,which is totally dependenton fossil fuels,like it is in most countries.So if we think of the energytransition as a marathon,the question is, how do we getto the finish line,how do we decarbonizethe rest of the economy?And it's fair to saythat if we don't succeed,it's difficult to see who will.So that is why I wantto talk to you about Costa Rica,because I believe we are a great candidatein pioneering a visionfor development without fossil fuels. If you know one thing about our country,it's that we don't have an army.So I'm going to take you back to 1948.That year, the countrywas coming out of civil war.Thousands of Costa Ricans had died,and families were bitterly split.And yet, a surprising ideawon the hearts and minds:we would reboot the country,and that Second Republicwould have no army.So we abolished it.And the president at the time,José Figueres,found a powerful wayby smashing the walls of an army base.The following year, 1949,we made that decision permanentin the new constitution,and that is why I can tell you that storynearly 70 years later.And I'm grateful.I'm grateful they made that decisionbefore I was born,because it allowed meand millions of othersto live in a very stable country. And you might be thinkingthat it was good luck,but it wasn't.There was a pattern of deliberate choices.In the '40s, Costa Ricans were givenfree education and free health care.We called that social guarantees.By abolishing the army,we were able to turn military spendinginto social spending,and that was a driver of stability.In the '50s —n(Applause) In the '50s, we startedinvesting in hydropower,and that kept us away from the trapof using fossil fuelsfor electricity generation,which is what the worldis struggling with today.In the '70s we invested in national parks,and that kept us awayfrom the deeply flawed logicof growth, growth, growth at any costthat you see others embracing,especially in the developing world.In the '90s, we pioneered paymentsfor ecosystem services,and that helped us reverse deforestationand boosted ecotourism,which today is a key engine of growth.So investing in environmental protectiondid not hurt our economy.Quite the opposite. And it doesn't mean we are perfect,and it doesn't meanwe don't have contradictions.That's not the point.The point is that,by making our own choices,we were able to develop resiliencein dealing with development problems. Also, if you take a country like ours,the GDP per capitais around 11,000 dollars,depending on how you measure it.But according tothe Social Progress Index,we are an absolute outlierwhen it comes to turning GDPinto social progress.Abolishing the army,investing in nature and people,did something very powerful, too.It shaped the narrative,the narrative of a small countrywith big ideas,and it was very empoweringto grow up with that narrative. So the question is,what is the next big ideafor this generation?And I believe what comes nextis for this generationto let go of fossil fuels for good,just as we did with the army. Fossil fuels create climate change.We know that,and we know how vulnerable we areto the impacts of climate change.So as a developing country,it is in our best interestto build development without fossil fuelsthat harm people in the first place.Becausewhy would we continue importing oilfor transportationif we can use electricity instead? Remember,this is the countrywhere electricitycomes from water in our rivers,heat from volcanoes,wind turbines, solar panels,biowaste.Abolishing fossil fuels meansdisrupting our transportation systemso that we can power our cars,buses and trains with electricityinstead of dirty energy. And transportation, let me tell you,has become an existential issuefor us Costa Ricans,because the model we haveis not working for us.It's hurting people,it's hurting companies,and it's hurting our health. Because when policiesand infrastructure fail,this is what happens on a daily basis.Two hours in the morning,two hours in the evening.I don't understand whywe have to accept this as normal.It's offensiveto have to waste our time like thisevery single day.And this highway is actually quite goodcompared to what you seein other countrieswhere traffic is exploding.You know, Costa Ricans call this \"presa.\"Presa means \"imprisoned.\"And people are turning violentin a country that is otherwisehappy in pura vida.It's happening.So a lot is at stake. The good newsis that when we talkabout clean transportationand different mobility,we're not talking aboutsome distant utopia out there.We're talking about electric mobilitythat is happening today.By 2022, electric carsand conventional carsare expected to cost the same,and cities are already tryingelectric buses.And these really cool creaturesare saving money,and they reduce pollution.So if we want to get ridof oil-based transportation, we can,because we have options nowthat we didn't have before.It's really exciting. But of course,some get very uncomfortablewith this idea,and they will come and they will tell youthat the world is stuck with oil,and so is Costa Rica, so get real.That's what they tell you.And you know what the answerto that argument is?That in 1948, we didn't saythe world is stuck with armies,so let's keep our army, too.No, we made a very brave choice,and that choice made the whole difference. So it's time for this generationto be brave againand abolish fossil fuels for good.And I'll give you three reasonswhy we have to do this. First,our model of transportationand urbanization is broken,so this is the best momentto redefine our urban and mobility future.We don't want citiesthat are built for cars.We want cities for peoplewhere we can walk and we can use bikes.And we want public transportation,lots of it,public transportationthat is clean and dignifying.Because if we continueadding fleets of conventional cars,our cities will become unbearable. Second, we have to change,but incremental changeis not going to be sufficient.We need transformational change.And there are someincremental projects in my country,and I am the first one to celebrate them.But let's not kid ourselves.We're not talking about ending upwith really beautiful electric cars hereand a few electric buses therewhile we keep investingin the same kind of infrastructure,more cars, more roads, more oil.We're talking aboutbreaking free from oil,and you cannot get therethrough incrementalism. Third, and you know this one,the world is hungry for inspiration.It craves stories of successin dealing with complex issues,especially in developing countries.So I believe Costa Ricacan be an inspiration to others,as we did last year when we disclosedthat for so many dayswe were not using any fossil fuelsin order to generate all our electricity.The news went viral around the world.Also, and this makes me extremely proud,a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres,played a decisive role in the negotiationsof the Paris climate agreement.So we have to protect that legacyand be an example. So what comes next?The people.How do we get people to own this?How do we get peopleto believe that it's possibleto build a society without fossil fuels?A lot of work fromthe ground up is needed. That is why, in 2014,we created Costa Rica Limpia.\"Limpia\" means \"clean,\"because we want to empowerand we want to inspire citizens.If citizens don't get engaged,clean transportation decisionswill be bogged down by endless,and I mean endless, technical discussions,and by avalanches of lobbyingby various established interests.Wanting to be a green countrypowered by renewablesis already part of our story.We should not let anybodytake that away from us. Last year, we brought peoplefrom our seven provincesto talk about climate changein terms that matter to them,and we also brought this yearanother group of Costa Ricansto talk about renewable energy.And you know what?These people disagree on almost everythingexcept on renewable energyand clean transportation and clean air.It brings people together. And the key to real participationis to help people not to feel small.People feel powerless,and they are tired of not being heard.So what we do is concrete things,and we translate technical issuesinto citizen languageto show that citizens have a role to playand can play it together.For the first time, we're trackingthe promises that were madeon clean transportation,and politicos knowthat they have to deliver it,but the tipping point will comewhen we form coalitions —citizens, companies,champions of public transportation —that will make electric mobilitythe new normal,especially in a developing country. By the time the next election comes,I believe every candidatewill have to disclose where they standon the abolition of fossil fuels.Because this questionhas to enter our mainstream politics.And I'm telling you,this is not a question of climate policyor environmental agenda.It's about the country that we wantand the cities that we haveand the cities that we wantand who makes that choice.Because at the end of the day,what we have to showis that development with renewable energyis good for the people,for Costa Ricans that are alive todayand especially for thosewho haven't been born. This is our National Museum today.It's bright and peaceful,and when you stand up in front of it,it's really hard to believethese were military barracksat the end of the '40s.We started a new lifewithout an army in this place,and here is where our abolitionof fossil fuels will be announced one day.And we will make history again. Thank you. (Applause) How do we build a society without fossil fuels? Using her native Costa Rica as an example of positive action on environmental protection and renewables, climate advocate Monica Araya outlines a bold vision for a world committed to clean energy in all sectors. In 2015 Monica Araya's native Costa Rica produced almost all of its electricity from renewable sources. She advocates for the next step: a fossil-fuel-free world.

76	"Imagine that you are a product designer.And you've designed a product,a new type of product,called the human immune system.You're pitching this productto a skeptical, strictlyno-nonsense manager.Let's call him Bob.I think we all knowat least one Bob, right?How would that go? Bob, I've got this incredible ideafor a completely new typeof personal health product.It's called the human immune system.I can see from your face thatyou're having some problems with this.Don't worry. I know it's very complicated.I don't want to take youthrough the gory details,I just want to tell you about someof the amazing features of this product.First of all, it cleverly uses redundancyby having millions of copiesof each component —leukocytes, white blood cells —before they're actually needed,to create a massive bufferagainst the unexpected.And it cleverly leverages diversityby having not just leukocytesbut B cells, T cells,natural killer cells, antibodies.The components don't really matter.The point is that together,this diversity of different approachescan cope with more or less anythingthat evolution has been able to throw up.And the design is completely modular.You have the surface barrierof the human skin,you have the very rapidly reactinginnate immune systemand then you have the highly targetedadaptive immune system.The point is, that if one system fails,another can take over,creating a virtually foolproof system. I can see I'm losing you, Bob,but stay with me,because here is the really killer feature.The product is completely adaptive.It's able to actually developtargeted antibodiesto threats that it's nevereven met before.It actually also does thiswith incredible prudence,detecting and reactingto every tiny threat,and furthermore, rememberingevery previous threat,in case they are ever encountered again.What I'm pitching you todayis actually not a stand-alone product.The product is embeddedin the larger system of the human body,and it works in complete harmonywith that system,to create this unprecedented levelof biological protection.So Bob, just tell me honestly,what do you think of my product? And Bob may say something like,I sincerely appreciatethe effort and passionthat have gone into your presentation,blah blah blah —n(Laughter) But honestly, it's total nonsense.You seem to be saying that the keyselling points of your productare that it is inefficient and complex.Didn't they teach you 80-20?And furthermore, you're sayingthat this product is siloed.It overreacts,makes things up as it goes alongand is actually designedfor somebody else's benefit.I'm sorry to break it to you,but I don't think this one is a winner. If we went with Bob's philosophy,I think we'd actually end upwith a more efficient immune system.And efficiency is always importantin the short term.Less complex, more efficient,more bang for the buck.Who could say no to that?Unfortunately, there's onevery tiny problem,and that is that the userof this product, you or I,would probably diewithin one week of the next winter,when we encountered a new strainof the influenza virus. I first became interestedin biology and business,and longevity and resilience,when I was asked a very unusual questionby the CEO of a global tech company.And the question was:What do we have to do to make surethat our company lasts 100 years?A seemingly innocent question,but actually, it's a little trickierthan you might think,considering that the averageUS public company nowcan expect a life span of only 30 years.That is less than half of the life spanthat its employees can expect to enjoy. Now, if you were the CEOof such a company,badgered by investorsand buffeted by change,we might forgive youfor not even worrying too muchabout what happens 30 years out.But here's something that shouldkeep you awake at night:the probability that your companywill not be around in five year's time,on average, is nowa staggering 32 percent.That's a one in three chancethat your company will be taken overor will fail within just five years. Let's come backto our tech CEO's question.Where better to turnfor advice than nature,that's been in the businessof life and deathfor longer than any company?As a lapsed biologist,I decided to immediately calla real biologist,my friend Simon Levin,Professor of Biology and Mathematicsat Princeton University.Together, we looked at a varietyof biological systems,ranging from natural tropical rainforeststhrough to managed forests and fisheries.And we asked ourselves the question:What makes these systemsresilient and enduring? And what we foundwas that the same six principlesthat we saw underpinningthe miracle of the human immune systemactually cropped up again and again,from redundancy through to embeddedness.In fact, we saw these principlesnot only in biologically enduring systems,we also found thembeing very characteristicof long-lived social systems,like the Roman Empireand the Catholic Church,believe it or not.We also went on to look at business,and found that these very same propertiesalso characterized businessesthat were resilient and long-lived,and we noted their absencefrom ones which were short-lived. Let's first take a look at what happenswhen the corporate immune systemcollapses.This beautiful building is partof the Shitennoji Temple Complexin Osaka, Japan.In fact, it's one of the oldesttemples in Japan.It was built by a Korean artisan,because at the time,Japan was not yet building temples.And this Korean artisan went onto found a temple-building company.Amazingly, his company, Kongo Gumi,was still around 1,428 years later.In fact, it became the oldestcontinuously operating companyin the world. So how is Kongo Gumi doing today?Not too well, I'm afraid.It borrowed very heavilyduring the bubble periodof the Japanese economy,to invest in real estate.And when the bubble burst,it couldn't refinance its loans.The company failed,and it was taken overby a major construction company.Tragically, after 40 generationsof very careful stewardshipby the Kongo family,Kongo Gumi succumbedto a spectacular lapsein the ability to applya principle of prudence. Speaking of company failures:we're all familiarwith the failure of Kodak,the company that declared bankruptcyin January 2012.Much more interesting,however, is the question:Why did Fujifilm —same product, same pressuresfrom digital technology, same time —why was Fujifilmable to survive and flourish? Fujifilm used its capabilitiesin chemistry, material science and opticsto diversify into a number of areas,ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals,to medical systems to biomaterials.Some of these diversificationattempts failed.But in aggregate,it was able to adaptits portfolio sufficientlyto survive and flourish.As the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it,the strategy succeededbecause it had \"more pockets and drawers\"than the rivals.He meant, of course,that they were able to createmore options than the rivals.Fujifilm survived because it appliedthe principles of prudence,diversityand adaptation. A catastrophic factory fire,like the one we see here,completely wiped out, in one evening,the only plant which supplied Toyotawith valves for car-braking systems.The ultimate test of resilience.Car production groundto a screeching halt.How was it, then, that Toyotawas able to recover car production?Can you imagine how long it took?Just five days.From having no braking valvesto complete recovery in five days.How was this possible?Toyota managed its network of suppliersin such a collaborative mannerthat it could work very quicklyand smoothly with suppliersto repurpose production,fill the missing braking valve capacityand have car production come online again.Toyota applied the principlesof modularity of its supply network,embeddedness in an integrated systemand the functional redundancyto be able to repurpose, smoothly,existing capacity. Now fortunately, few companiessuccumb to catastrophic fires.But we do read in the newspaperevery day about companiessuccumbing to the disruptionof technology.How is it, then, that the consumeroptics giant Essiloris able to avoid technology disruption,and even profit from it?And yes, technology disruptionis not only a big dealin software and electronics.Essilor carefully scansthe competitive environmentfor potentially disruptive technologies.It acquires those technologies very early,before they've become expensiveor competitors have mobilized around them,and it then developsthose technologies itself,even at the risk of failureor the risk of self-disruption.Essilor stays ahead of its game,and has delivered spectacular performancefor over 40 years,by using the principlesof prudence and adaptation. OK, if these principles are so powerful,you might be thinking,why are they not commonplace in business?Why do we not use these words every day?Well, change has to firststart in the mind.If we think back to our pitch to Bob,in order to apply the principlesthat underpin the miracleof the human immune system,we first need to think differentlyabout business.Now typically, when we thinkabout business,we use what I call \"mechanical thinking.\"We set goals,we analyze problems,we construct and we adhere to plans,and more than anything else,we stress efficiencyand short-term performance.Now, don't get me wrong —this is a splendidly practicaland effective wayof addressing relatively simple challengesin relatively stable environments.It's the way that Bob — and probablymany of us, myself included —process most business problemswe're faced with every day.In fact, it was a pretty goodmental model for business —overall —until about the mid-1980s,when the conjunction of globalizationand a revolution in technologyand telecommunicationsmade business far moredynamic and unpredictable. But what about those more dynamicand unpredictable situationsthat we now increasingly face?I think in additionto the mechanical thinking,we now need to master the artof biological thinking,as embodied by our six principles.In other words, we need to thinkmore modestly and subtlyabout when and howwe can shape, rather than control,unpredictable and complex situations.It's a little like the differencebetween throwing a balland releasing a bird.The ball would head in a straight line,probably towards the intended target,and the bird certainly would not. So what do you think?Sounds a little impractical,a little theoretical, perhaps?Not at all.Every small entrepreneurial companynaturally thinks and acts biologically.Why?Because it lacks the resourcesto shape its environmentthrough brute force.It lacks the scale to buffer change,and it's constantly thinkingabout the tough oddsfor a start-up to survive.Now, the irony is, of course,that every large company started offas a small, entrepreneurial company.But along the way somewhere,many have lost this abilityto think and act biologically.They need to rejuvenatetheir ability to think biologicallyin order to survive and thrivein today's environment. So let's not just thinkabout short-term performance.Every company I know spends plenty of timethinking about the centralquestion of strategy:How good is our competitive game?In addition, let's also considerthe second, more biologicaland equally important question:How long will that game last?

77	"So this is my niece.Her name is Yahli.She is nine months old.Her mum is a doctor,and her dad is a lawyer.By the time Yahli goes to college,the jobs her parents doare going to look dramatically different. In 2013, researchers at Oxford Universitydid a study on the future of work.They concluded that almost onein every two jobs have a high riskof being automated by machines.Machine learning is the technologythat's responsible for mostof this disruption.It's the most powerful branchof artificial intelligence.It allows machines to learn from dataand mimic some of the thingsthat humans can do.My company, Kaggle, operateson the cutting edge of machine learning.We bring togetherhundreds of thousands of expertsto solve important problemsfor industry and academia.This gives us a unique perspectiveon what machines can do,what they can't doand what jobs they mightautomate or threaten. Machine learning started making its wayinto industry in the early '90s.It started with relatively simple tasks.It started with things like assessingcredit risk from loan applications,sorting the mail by readinghandwritten characters from zip codes.Over the past few years, we have madedramatic breakthroughs.Machine learning is now capableof far, far more complex tasks.In 2012, Kaggle challenged its communityto build an algorithmthat could grade high-school essays.The winning algorithmswere able to match the gradesgiven by human teachers.Last year, we issuedan even more difficult challenge.Can you take images of the eyeand diagnose an eye diseasecalled diabetic retinopathy?Again, the winning algorithmswere able to match the diagnosesgiven by human ophthalmologists. Now, given the right data,machines are going to outperform humansat tasks like this.A teacher might read 10,000 essaysover a 40-year career.An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes.A machine can read millions of essaysor see millions of eyeswithin minutes.We have no chance of competingagainst machineson frequent, high-volume tasks. But there are things we can dothat machines can't do.Where machines have madevery little progressis in tackling novel situations.They can't handle thingsthey haven't seen many times before.The fundamental limitationsof machine learningis that it needs to learnfrom large volumes of past data.Now, humans don't.We have the ability to connectseemingly disparate threadsto solve problems we've never seen before. Percy Spencer was a physicistworking on radar during World War II,when he noticed the magnetronwas melting his chocolate bar.He was able to connect his understandingof electromagnetic radiationwith his knowledge of cookingin order to invent — any guesses? —the microwave oven. Now, this is a particularly remarkableexample of creativity.But this sort of cross-pollinationhappens for each of us in small waysthousands of times per day.Machines cannot compete with uswhen it comes to tacklingnovel situations,and this puts a fundamental limiton the human tasksthat machines will automate. So what does this meanfor the future of work?The future state of any single job liesin the answer to a single question:To what extent is that job reducibleto frequent, high-volume tasks,and to what extent does it involvetackling novel situations?On frequent, high-volume tasks,machines are getting smarter and smarter.Today they grade essays.They diagnose certain diseases.Over coming years,they're going to conduct our audits,and they're going to read boilerplatefrom legal contracts.Accountants and lawyers are still needed.They're going to be neededfor complex tax structuring,for pathbreaking litigation.But machines will shrink their ranksand make these jobs harder to come by. Now, as mentioned,machines are not making progresson novel situations.The copy behind a marketing campaignneeds to grab consumers' attention.It has to stand out from the crowd.Business strategy meansfinding gaps in the market,things that nobody else is doing.It will be humans that are creatingthe copy behind our marketing campaigns,and it will be humans that are developingour business strategy. So Yahli, whatever you decide to do,let every day bring you a new challenge.If it does, then you will stayahead of the machines. Thank you. (Applause) Machine learning isn't just for simple tasks like assessing credit risk and sorting mail anymore — today, it's capable of far more complex applications, like grading essays and diagnosing diseases. With these advances comes an uneasy question: Will a robot do your job in the future? Anthony Goldbloom crowdsources solutions to difficult problems using machine learning.

79	"Imagine you are a partof a crew of astronautstraveling to Mars or some distant planet.The travel time could take a yearor even longer.The space on board and the resourceswould be limited.So you and the crew would haveto figure out how to produce foodwith minimal inputs.What if you could bring with youjust a few packets of seeds,and grow crops in a matter of hours?And what if those cropswould then make more seeds,enabling you to feed the entire crewwith just those few packets of seedsfor the duration of the trip? Well, the scientists at NASA actuallyfigured out a way to do this.What they came up withwas actually quite interesting.It involved microorganisms,which are single-celled organisms.And they also used hydrogen from water.The types of microbes that they usedwere called hydrogenotrophs,and with these hydrogenotrophs,you can create a virtuous carbon cyclethat would sustain lifeonboard a spacecraft.Astronauts would breathe outcarbon dioxide,that carbon dioxide would thenbe captured by the microbesand converted into a nutritious,carbon-rich crop.The astronauts would then eatthat carbon-rich cropand exhale the carbon outin the form of carbon dioxide,which would then be capturedby the microbes,to create a nutritious crop,which then would be exhaledin the form of carbon dioxideby the astronauts.So in this way, a closed-loopcarbon cycle is created. So why is this important?We need carbon to survive as humans,and we get our carbon from food.On a long space journey,you simply wouldn't be able to pick upany carbon along the way,so you'd have to figure outhow to recycle it on board. This is a clever solution, right?But the thing is, that researchdidn't really go anywhere.We haven't yet gone to Mars.We haven't yet gone to another planet.And this was actually donein the '60s and '70s.So a colleague of mine,Dr. John Reed, and I,were interested, actually,in carbon recycling here on Earth.We wanted to come upwith technical solutionsto address climate change.And we discovered this researchby reading some papers publishedin the '60s — 1967 and later —articles about this work.And we thought it was a really good idea.So we said, well, Earthis actually like a spaceship.We have limited spaceand limited resources,and on Earth, we really doneed to figure outhow to recycle our carbon better. So we had the idea,can we take some of theseNASA-type ideas and apply themto our carbon problem here on Earth?Could we cultivatethese NASA-type microbesin order to makevaluable products here on Earth?We started a company to do it.And in that company, we discoveredthat these hydrogenotrophs —which I'll actually callnature's supercharged carbon recyclers —we found that they are a powerfulclass of microbesthat had been largely overlookedand understudied,and that they could makesome really valuable products. So we began cultivating these products,these microbes, in our lab.We found that we can makeessential amino acids from carbon dioxideusing these microbes.And we even made a protein-rich mealthat has an amino acid profilesimilar to what you might findin some animal proteins.We began cultivating them even further,and we found that we can make oil.Oils are used to manufacturemany products.We made an oil that was similarto a citrus oil,which can be used for flavoringand for fragrances,but it also can be usedas a biodegradable cleaneror even as a jet fuel.And we made an oilthat's similar to palm oil.Palm oil is used to manufacturea wide range of consumerand industrial goods. We began working with manufacturersto scale up this technology,and we're currently working with themto bring some of these products to market.We believe this type of technologycan indeed help usprofitably recycle carbon dioxideinto valuable products —something that's beneficialfor the planetbut also beneficial for business.That's what we're doing today.But tomorrow, this type of technologyand using these types of microbesactually could help usdo something even greaterif we take it to the next level.We believe that this type of technologycan actually help us addressan issue with agricultureand allow us to createa type of agriculture that's sustainable,that will allow us to scaleto meet the demands of tomorrow. And why might we needa sustainable agriculture?Well, actually, it is estimatedthat the population will reachabout 10 billion by 2050,and we're projecting that we will needto increase food productionby 70 percent.In addition, we will need many moreresources and raw materialsto make consumer goodsand industrial goods.So how will we scale to meet that demand? Well, modern agriculture simply cannotsustainably scale to meet that demand.There are a number of reasons why.One of them is that modern agricultureis one of the largest emittersof greenhouse gases.In fact, it emits more greenhouse gasesthan our cars, our trucks, our planesand our trains combined.Another reason is that modern agsimply takes up a whole lot of land.We have cleared 19.4 million square milesfor crops and livestock.What does that look like?Well, that's roughly the sizeof South America and Africa combined. Let me give you a specific example.In Indonesia, an amountof virgin rainforest was clearedtotaling the sizeof approximately Ireland,between 2000 and 2012.Just think of allof the species, the diversity,that was removed in the process,whether plant life, insectsor animal life.And a natural carbon sinkwas also removed. So let me make this real for you.This clearing happened primarilyto make room for palm plantations.And as I mentioned before,palm oil is usedto manufacture many products.In fact, it is estimatedthat over 50 percent of consumer productsare manufactured using palm oil.And that includes thingslike ice cream, cookies ...It includes cooking oils.It also includes detergents,lotions, soaps.You and I bothprobably have numerous itemsin our kitchens and our bathroomsthat were manufactured using palm oil.So you and I are direct beneficiariesof removed rainforests. Modern ag has some problems,and we need solutionsif we want to scale sustainably.I believe that microbescan be a part of the answer —specifically, these superchargedcarbon recyclers.These supercharged carbon recyclers,like plants, serve asthe natural recyclersin their ecosystems where they thrive.And they thrive in exotic places on Earth,like hydrothermal vents and hot springs.In those ecosystems,they take carbon and recycle itinto the nutrients neededfor those ecosystems.And they're rich in nutrients,such as oils and proteins,minerals and carbohydrates. And actually, microbes are alreadyan integral part of our everyday lives.If you enjoy a glass of pinot noiron a Friday night,after a long, hard work week,then you are enjoyinga product of microbes.If you enjoy a beerfrom your local microbrewery —a product of microbes.Or bread, or cheese, or yogurt.These are all products of microbes.But the beauty and power associatedwith these supercharged carbon recyclerslies in the fact that they canactually produce in a matter of hoursversus months.That means we can make cropsmuch faster than we're making them today.They grow in the dark,so they can grow in any seasonand in any geography and any location.They can grow in containersthat require minimal space.And we can get to a typeof vertical agriculture.Instead of our traditionalhorizontal agriculturethat requires so much land,we can scale vertically,and as a resultproduce much more product per area. If we implement this type of approachand use these carbon recyclers,then we wouldn't have to removeany more rainforeststo make the food and the goodsthat we consume.Because, at a large scale,you can actually make 10,000 timesmore output per land areathan you could — for instance,if you used soybeans —if you planted soybeanson that same area of landover a period of a year.Ten thousand timesover a period of a year.So this is what I meanby a new type of agriculture.And this is what I meanby developing a systemthat allows us to sustainably scaleto meet the demands of 10 billion. And what would be the productsof this new type of agriculture?Well, we've already made a protein meal,so you can imagine somethingsimilar to a soybean meal,or even cornmeal, or wheat flour.We've already made oils,so you can imagine somethingsimilar to coconut oilor olive oil or soybean oil.So this type of crop canactually produce the nutrientsthat would give us pasta and bread,cakes, nutritional items of many sorts.Furthermore, since oil is usedto manufacture multiple other goods,industrial products and consumer products,you can imagine being able to makedetergents, soaps, lotions, etc.,using these types of crops. Not only are we running out of space,but if we continue to operateunder the status quowith modern agriculture,we run the risk of robbing our progenyof a beautiful planet.But it doesn't have to be this way.We can imagine a future of abundance.Let us create systems that keepplanet Earth, our spaceship,not only from not crashing,but let us also develop systemsand ways of livingthat will be beneficialto the lives of ourselvesand the 10 billion that willbe on this planet by 2050. Thank you very much. (Applause) We're heading for a world population of 10 billion people — but what will we all eat? Lisa Dyson rediscovered an idea developed by NASA in the 1960s for deep-space travel, and it could be a key to reinventing how we grow food. Lisa Dyson thinks a new class of crops might help us reinvent agriculture — and feed the world. Lisa Dyson thinks a new class of crops might help us reinvent agriculture — and feed the world."
80	"I'll never forget the soundof laughing with my friends.I'll never forget the soundof my mother's voiceright before I fell asleep.And I'll never forgetthe comforting sound of watertrickling down a stream.Imagine my fear, pure fear,when, at the age of 10,I was told I was going to lose my hearing.And over the next five years,it progressed until I was classifiedas profoundly deaf. But I believe that losing my hearingwas one of the greatest giftsI've ever received.You see, I get to experiencethe world in a unique way.And I believe thatthese unique experiencesthat people with disabilities haveis what's going to help usmake and design a better worldfor everyone — both for peoplewith and without disabilities. I used to be a disability rights lawyer,and I spent a lot of my timefocused on enforcing the law,ensuring that accommodations were made.And then I had to quicklylearn international policy,because I was asked to workon the UN Conventionthat protects people with disabilities.As the leader of the NGO there,I spent most of my energytrying to convince peopleabout the capabilitiesof people with disabilities.But somewhere along the way,and after many career transitionsthat my parents weren't so happy about —n(Laughter) I stumbled upon a solutionthat I believe may bean even more powerful toolto solve some of the world'sgreatest problems,disability or not.And that tool is called design thinking. Design thinking is a processfor innovation and problem solving.There are five steps.The first is defining the problemand understanding its constraints.The second is observing peoplein real-life situationsand empathizing with them.Third, throwing out hundreds of ideas —the more the better,the wilder the better.Fourth, prototyping:gathering whatever you can,whatever you can find,to mimic your solution, to test itand to refine it.And finally, implementation:ensuring that the solutionyou came up with is sustainable. Warren Berger says that design thinkingteaches us to look sideways,to reframe, to refine, to experimentand, probably most importantly,ask those stupid questions.Design thinkers believethat everyone is creative.They believe in bringing peoplefrom multiple disciplines together,because they want to sharemultiple perspectivesand bring them togetherand ultimately merge themto form something new. Design thinking is such a successfuland versatile toolthat it has been appliedin almost every industry.I saw the potential that it hadfor the issues I faced,so I decided to go back to schooland get my master's in social design.This looks at how to use designto create positive change in the world.While I was there,I fell in love with woodworking.But what I quickly realizedwas that I was missing out on something.As you're working with a tool,right before it's aboutto kick back at you —which means the piece or the tooljumps back at you —it makes a sound.And I couldn't hear this sound.So I decided,why not try and solve it?My solution was a pair of safety glassesthat were engineeredto visually alert the userto pitch changes in the tool,before the human ear could pick it up.Why hadn't tool designersthought of this before? (Laughter) Two reasons: one, I was a beginner.I wasn't weighed down by expertiseor conventional wisdom.The second is: I was Deaf.My unique experience of the worldhelped inform my solution. And as I went on, I kept running intomore and more solutionsthat were originally madefor people with disabilities,and that ended up being picked up,embraced and loved by the mainstream,disability or not.This is an OXO potato peeler.It was originally designedfor people with arthritis,but it was so comfortable,everybody loved it.Text messaging: that was originallydesigned for people who are Deaf.And as you know,everybody loves that, too. (Laughter) I started thinking:What if we changed our mindset?What if we started designingfor disability first —not the norm?As you see, when we designfor disability first,we often stumble uponsolutions that are not only inclusive,but also are often betterthan when we design for the norm. And this excites me,because this means that the energyit takes to accommodate someonewith a disabilitycan be leveraged, molded and played withas a force for creativity and innovation.This moves us from the mindsetof trying to change the heartsand the deficiency mindset of tolerance,to becoming an alchemist,the type of magician that this worldso desperately needsto solve some of its greatest problems. Now, I also believethat people with disabilitieshave great potential to be designerswithin this design-thinking process.Without knowing it, from a very early age,I've been a design thinker,fine-tuning my skills.Design thinkers are, by nature,problem solvers.So imagine listening to a conversationand only understanding50 percent of what is said.You can't ask them to repeatevery single word.They would just get frustrated with you.So without even realizing it,my solution was to takethe muffled sound I heard,that was the beat,and turn it into a rhythmand place it with the lips I read.Years later, someone commentedthat my writing had a rhythm to it.Well, this is because I experienceconversations as rhythms.I also became really,really good at failing. (Laughter) Quite literally.My first semester in Spanish, I got a D.But what I learnedwas that when I picked myself upand changed a few things around,eventually, I succeeded.Similarly, design thinkingencourages people to failand fail often,because eventually, you will succeed.Very few great innovations in this worldhave come from someone succeedingon the first try. I also experienced this lesson in sports.I'll never forget my coachsaying to my mom,\"If she just didn't have her hearing loss,she would be on the national team.\"But what my coach, and what Ididn't even know at the time,was that my hearing lossactually helped me excel at sports.You see, when you lose your hearing,not only do you adapt your behavior,but you also adapt your physical senses.One example of thisis that my visualattention span increased.Imagine a soccer player,coming down the left flank.Imagine being goalkeeper, like I was,and the ball is comingdown the left flank.A person with normal hearingwould have the visual perspective of this.I had the benefit of a spectrum this wide.So I picked up the players over here,that were moving aboutand coming down the field.And I picked them up quicker,so that if the ball was passed,I could reposition myselfand be ready for that shot. So as you can see,I've been a design thinkerfor nearly all my life.My observation skills have been honedso that I pick up on thingsthat others would never pick up on.My constant need to adapthas made me a great ideatorand problem solver.And I've often had to do thiswithin limitations and constraints.This is something that designersalso have to deal with frequently. My work most recently took me to Haiti.Design thinkers often seek outextreme situations,because that often informssome of their best designs.And Haiti — it was like a perfect storm. I lived and workedwith 300 Deaf individualsthat were relocatedafter the 2010 earthquake.But five and a half years later,there still was no electricity;there still was no safe drinking water;there were still no job opportunities;there was still rampant crime,and it went unpunished.International aid organizationscame one by one.But they camewith pre-determined solutions.They didn't come readyto observe and to adaptbased on the community's needs.One organization gave themgoats and chickens.But they didn't realizethat there was so much hungerin that community,that when the Deaf went to sleepat night and couldn't hear,people broke into their yardsand their homesand stole these chickens and goats,and eventually they were all gone. Now, if that organizationhad taken the timeto observe Deaf people,to observe the community,they would have realized their problemand perhaps they would havecome up with a solution,something like a solar light,lighting up a secure pento put them in at nightto ensure their safety. You don't have to be a design thinkerto insert the ideasI've shared with you today.You are creative.You are a designer —everyone is.Let people like me help you.Let people with disabilitieshelp you look sideways,and in the process,solve some of the greatest problems. That's it. Thank you. (Applause) \"I believe that losing my hearing was one of the greatest gifts I've ever received,\" says Elise Roy. As a disability rights lawyer and design thinker, she knows that being Deaf gives her a unique way of experiencing and reframing the world — a perspective that could solve some of our largest problems. As she says: \"When we design for disability first, you often stumble upon solutions that are better than those when we design for the norm.\"nElise Roy thinks that designers have the capacity and responsibility to address and resolve human problems on micro and macro scales and contribute to social well-being.

81	"So, I lead a team at Googlethat works on machine intelligence;in other words, the engineering disciplineof making computers and devicesable to do some of the thingsthat brains do.And this makes usinterested in real brainsand neuroscience as well,and especially interestedin the things that our brains dothat are still far superiorto the performance of computers. Historically, one of those areashas been perception,the process by which thingsout there in the world —sounds and images —can turn into concepts in the mind.This is essential for our own brains,and it's also pretty useful on a computer.The machine perception algorithms,for example, that our team makes,are what enable your pictureson Google Photos to become searchable,based on what's in them.The flip side of perception is creativity:turning a concept into somethingout there into the world.So over the past year,our work on machine perceptionhas also unexpectedly connectedwith the world of machine creativityand machine art. I think Michelangelohad a penetrating insightinto to this dual relationshipbetween perception and creativity.This is a famous quote of his:\"Every block of stonehas a statue inside of it,and the job of the sculptoris to discover it.\"So I think that whatMichelangelo was getting atis that we create by perceiving,and that perception itselfis an act of imaginationand is the stuff of creativity. The organ that does all the thinkingand perceiving and imagining,of course, is the brain.And I'd like to beginwith a brief bit of historyabout what we know about brains.Because unlike, say,the heart or the intestines,you really can't say very muchabout a brain by just looking at it,at least with the naked eye.The early anatomists who looked at brainsgave the superficial structuresof this thing all kinds of fanciful names,like hippocampus, meaning \"little shrimp.\"But of course that sort of thingdoesn't tell us very muchabout what's actually going on inside. The first person who, I think, reallydeveloped some kind of insightinto what was going on in the brainwas the great Spanish neuroanatomist,Santiago Ramón y Cajal,in the 19th century,who used microscopy and special stainsthat could selectively fill inor render in very high contrastthe individual cells in the brain,in order to start to understandtheir morphologies.And these are the kinds of drawingsthat he made of neuronsin the 19th century. This is from a bird brain.And you see this incredible varietyof different sorts of cells,even the cellular theory itselfwas quite new at this point.And these structures,these cells that have these arborizations,these branches that can govery, very long distances —this was very novel at the time.They're reminiscent, of course, of wires.That might have been obviousto some people in the 19th century;the revolutions of wiring and electricitywere just getting underway.But in many ways,these microanatomical drawingsof Ramón y Cajal's, like this one,they're still in some ways unsurpassed. We're still more than a century later,trying to finish the jobthat Ramón y Cajal started.These are raw data from our collaboratorsat the Max Planck Instituteof Neuroscience.And what our collaborators have doneis to image little pieces of brain tissue.The entire sample hereis about one cubic millimeter in size,and I'm showing you a very,very small piece of it here.That bar on the left is about one micron.The structures you see are mitochondriathat are the size of bacteria.And these are consecutive slicesthrough this very, verytiny block of tissue.Just for comparison's sake,the diameter of an average strandof hair is about 100 microns.So we're looking at somethingmuch, much smallerthan a single strand of hair. And from these kinds of serialelectron microscopy slices,one can start to make reconstructionsin 3D of neurons that look like these.So these are sort of in the samestyle as Ramón y Cajal.Only a few neurons lit up,because otherwise we wouldn'tbe able to see anything here.It would be so crowded,so full of structure,of wiring all connectingone neuron to another. So Ramón y Cajal was a little bitahead of his time,and progress on understanding the brainproceeded slowlyover the next few decades.But we knew that neurons used electricity,and by World War II, our technologywas advanced enoughto start doing real electricalexperiments on live neuronsto better understand how they worked.This was the very same timewhen computers were being invented,very much based on the ideaof modeling the brain —of \"intelligent machinery,\"as Alan Turing called it,one of the fathers of computer science. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pittslooked at Ramón y Cajal's drawingof visual cortex,which I'm showing here.This is the cortex that processesimagery that comes from the eye.And for them, this lookedlike a circuit diagram.So there are a lot of detailsin McCulloch and Pitts's circuit diagramthat are not quite right.But this basic ideathat visual cortex works like a seriesof computational elementsthat pass informationone to the next in a cascade,is essentially correct. Let's talk for a momentabout what a model for processingvisual information would need to do.The basic task of perceptionis to take an image like this one and say,\"That's a bird,\"which is a very simple thingfor us to do with our brains.But you should all understandthat for a computer,this was pretty much impossiblejust a few years ago.The classical computing paradigmis not one in whichthis task is easy to do. So what's going on between the pixels,between the image of the birdand the word \"bird,\"is essentially a set of neuronsconnected to each otherin a neural network,as I'm diagramming here.This neural network could be biological,inside our visual cortices,or, nowadays, we startto have the capabilityto model such neural networkson the computer.And I'll show you whatthat actually looks like. So the pixels you can thinkabout as a first layer of neurons,and that's, in fact,how it works in the eye —that's the neurons in the retina.And those feed forwardinto one layer after another layer,after another layer of neurons,all connected by synapsesof different weights.The behavior of this networkis characterized by the strengthsof all of those synapses.Those characterize the computationalproperties of this network.And at the end of the day,you have a neuronor a small group of neuronsthat light up, saying, \"bird.\"nNow I'm going to representthose three things —the input pixels and the synapsesin the neural network,and bird, the output —by three variables: x, w and y.There are maybe a million or so x's —a million pixels in that image.There are billions or trillions of w's,which represent the weights of allthese synapses in the neural network.And there's a very small number of y's,of outputs that that network has.\"Bird\" is only four letters, right?So let's pretend that thisis just a simple formula,x \"x\" w = y.I'm putting the times in scare quotesbecause what's reallygoing on there, of course,is a very complicated seriesof mathematical operations. That's one equation.There are three variables.And we all knowthat if you have one equation,you can solve one variableby knowing the other two things.So the problem of inference,that is, figuring outthat the picture of a bird is a bird,is this one:it's where y is the unknownand w and x are known.You know the neural network,you know the pixels.As you can see, that's actuallya relatively straightforward problem.You multiply two times threeand you're done.I'll show you an artificial neural networkthat we've built recently,doing exactly that. This is running in real timeon a mobile phone,and that's, of course,amazing in its own right,that mobile phones can do so manybillions and trillions of operationsper second.What you're looking at is a phonelooking at one after anotherpicture of a bird,and actually not only saying,\"Yes, it's a bird,\"but identifying the species of birdwith a network of this sort.So in that picture,the x and the w are known,and the y is the unknown.I'm glossing over the verydifficult part, of course,which is how on earthdo we figure out the w,the brain that can do such a thing?How would we ever learn such a model? So this process of learning,of solving for w,if we were doing thiswith the simple equationin which we think about these as numbers,we know exactly how to do that: 6 = 2 x w,well, we divide by two and we're done.The problem is with this operator.So, division —we've used division becauseit's the inverse to multiplication,but as I've just said,the multiplication is a bit of a lie here.This is a very, very complicated,very non-linear operation;it has no inverse.So we have to figure out a wayto solve the equationwithout a division operator.And the way to do thatis fairly straightforward.You just say, let's playa little algebra trick,and move the six overto the right-hand side of the equation.Now, we're still using multiplication.And that zero — let's thinkabout it as an error.In other words, if we've solvedfor w the right way,then the error will be zero.And if we haven't gotten it quite right,the error will be greater than zero. So now we can just take guessesto minimize the error,and that's the sort of thingcomputers are very good at.So you've taken an initial guess:what if w = 0?Well, then the error is 6.What if w = 1? The error is 4.And then the computer cansort of play Marco Polo,and drive down the error close to zero.As it does that, it's gettingsuccessive approximations to w.Typically, it never quite gets there,but after about a dozen steps,we're up to w = 2.999,which is close enough.And this is the learning process. So remember that what's been going on hereis that we've been takinga lot of known x's and known y'sand solving for the w in the middlethrough an iterative process.It's exactly the same waythat we do our own learning.We have many, many images as babiesand we get told, \"This is a bird;this is not a bird.\"And over time, through iteration,we solve for w, we solvefor those neural connections. So now, we've heldx and w fixed to solve for y;that's everyday, fast perception.We figure out how we can solve for w,that's learning, which is a lot harder,because we need to do error minimization,using a lot of training examples. And about a year ago,Alex Mordvintsev, on our team,decided to experimentwith what happens if we try solving for x,given a known w and a known y.In other words,you know that it's a bird,and you already have your neural networkthat you've trained on birds,but what is the picture of a bird?It turns out that by using exactlythe same error-minimization procedure,one can do that with the networktrained to recognize birds,and the result turns out to be ...a picture of birds.So this is a picture of birdsgenerated entirely by a neural networkthat was trained to recognize birds,just by solving for xrather than solving for y,and doing that iteratively. Here's another fun example.This was a work madeby Mike Tyka in our group,which he calls \"Animal Parade.\"It reminds me a little bitof William Kentridge's artworks,in which he makes sketches, rubs them out,makes sketches, rubs them out,and creates a movie this way.In this case,what Mike is doing is varying yover the space of different animals,in a network designedto recognize and distinguishdifferent animals from each other.And you get this strange, Escher-likemorph from one animal to another. Here he and Alex togetherhave tried reducingthe y's to a space of only two dimensions,thereby making a mapout of the space of all thingsrecognized by this network.Doing this kind of synthesisor generation of imageryover that entire surface,varying y over the surface,you make a kind of map —a visual map of all the thingsthe network knows how to recognize.The animals are all here;\"armadillo\" is right in that spot. You can do this with other kindsof networks as well.This is a network designedto recognize faces,to distinguish one face from another.And here, we're puttingin a y that says, \"me,\"my own face parameters.And when this thing solves for x,it generates this rather crazy,kind of cubist, surreal,psychedelic picture of mefrom multiple points of view at once.The reason it looks likemultiple points of view at onceis because that network is designedto get rid of the ambiguityof a face being in one poseor another pose,being looked at with one kind of lighting,another kind of lighting.So when you dothis sort of reconstruction,if you don't use some sort of guide imageor guide statistics,then you'll get a sort of confusionof different points of view,because it's ambiguous.This is what happens if Alex useshis own face as a guide imageduring that optimization processto reconstruct my own face.So you can see it's not perfect.There's still quite a lot of work to doon how we optimizethat optimization process.But you start to get somethingmore like a coherent face,rendered using my own face as a guide. You don't have to startwith a blank canvasor with white noise.When you're solving for x,you can begin with an x,that is itself already some other image.That's what this little demonstration is.This is a networkthat is designed to categorizeall sorts of different objects —man-made structures, animals ...Here we're startingwith just a picture of clouds,and as we optimize,basically, this network is figuring outwhat it sees in the clouds.And the more timeyou spend looking at this,the more things you alsowill see in the clouds.You could also use the face networkto hallucinate into this,and you get some pretty crazy stuff. (Laughter) Or, Mike has done some other experimentsin which he takes that cloud image,hallucinates, zooms, hallucinates,zooms hallucinates, zooms.And in this way,you can get a sort of fugue stateof the network, I suppose,or a sort of free association,in which the networkis eating its own tail.So every image is now the basis for,\"What do I think I see next?What do I think I see next?What do I think I see next?\"nI showed this for the first time in publicto a group at a lecture in Seattlecalled \"Higher Education\" —this was right aftermarijuana was legalized. (Laughter) So I'd like to finish up quicklyby just noting that this technologyis not constrained.I've shown you purely visual examplesbecause they're really fun to look at.It's not a purely visual technology.Our artist collaborator, Ross Goodwin,has done experiments involvinga camera that takes a picture,and then a computer in his backpackwrites a poem using neural networks,based on the contents of the image.And that poetry neural networkhas been trainedon a large corpus of 20th-century poetry.And the poetry is, you know,I think, kind of not bad, actually. (Laughter) In closing,I think that per Michelangelo,I think he was right;perception and creativityare very intimately connected.What we've just seen are neural networksthat are entirely trained to discriminate,or to recognize differentthings in the world,able to be run in reverse, to generate.One of the things that suggests to meis not only thatMichelangelo really did seethe sculpture in the blocks of stone,but that any creature,any being, any alienthat is able to doperceptual acts of that sortis also able to createbecause it's exactly the samemachinery that's used in both cases. Also, I think that perceptionand creativity are by no meansuniquely human.We start to have computer modelsthat can do exactly these sorts of things.And that ought to be unsurprising;the brain is computational. And finally,computing began as an exercisein designing intelligent machinery.It was very much modeled after the ideaof how could we make machines intelligent.And we finally are starting to fulfill nowsome of the promisesof those early pioneers,of Turing and von Neumannand McCulloch and Pitts.And I think that computingis not just about accountingor playing Candy Crush or something.From the beginning,we modeled them after our minds.And they give us both the abilityto understand our own minds betterand to extend them. Thank you very much. (Applause) We're on the edge of a new frontier in art and creativity — and it's not human. Blaise Agüera y Arcas, principal scientist at Google, works with deep neural networks for machine perception and distributed learning. In this captivating demo, he shows how neural nets trained to recognize images can be run in reverse, to generate them. The results: spectacular, hallucinatory collages (and poems!) that defy categorization. \"Perception and creativity are very intimately connected,\" Agüera y Arcas says. \"Any creature, any being that is able to do perceptual acts is also able to create.\"nBlaise Agüera y Arcas works on machine learning at Google.

82	"Once there was a star.Like everything else, she was born;grew to be around 30 timesthe mass of our sunand lived for a very long time.Exactly how long,people cannot really tell.Just like everything in life,she reached the endof her regular star dayswhen her heart, the core of her life,exhausted its fuel.But that was no end. She transformed into a supernova,and in the processreleasing a tremendous amount of energy,outshining the rest of the galaxyand emitting, in one second,the same amount of energyour sun will release in 10 days.And she evolvedinto another role in our galaxy. Supernova explosions are very extreme.But the ones that emit gamma raysare even more extreme.In the process of becoming a supernova,the interior of the star collapsesunder its own weightand it starts rotating ever faster,like an ice skater when pullingtheir arms in close to their body.In that way, it starts rotating very fastand it increases, powerfully,its magnetic field.The matter around the staris dragged around,and some energy from that rotationis transferred to that matterand the magnetic fieldis increased even further.In that way, our star had extra energyto outshine the rest of the galaxyin brightness and gamma ray emission. My star, the one in my story,became what is known as a magnetar.And just for your information,the magnetic field of a magnetaris 1,000 trillion timesthe magnetic field of Earth.The most energetic eventsever measured by astronomerscarry the name gamma-ray burstsbecause we observe themas bursts most or explosions,most strongly measured as gamma-ray light.Our star, like the one in our storythat became a magnetar,is detected as a gamma-ray burstduring the most energeticportion of the explosion.Yet, even though gamma-ray burstsare the strongest eventsever measured by astronomers,we cannot see them with our naked eye.We depend, we rely on other methodsin order to study this gamma-ray light.We cannot see them with our naked eye.We can only seean itty bitty, tiny portionof the electromagnetic spectrumthat we call visible light.And beyond that, we rely on other methods. Yet as astronomers,we study a wider range of lightand we depend on other methods to do that.On the screen, it may look like this.You're seeing a plot.That is a light curve.It's a plot of intensityof light over time.It is a gamma-ray light curve.Sighted astronomersdepend on this kind of plotin order to interpret howthis light intensity changes over time.On the left, you will be seeingthe light intensity without a burst,and on the right, you will be seeingthe light intensity with the burst. Early during my career,I could also see this kind of plot.But then, I lost my sight.I completely lost my sightbecause of extended illness,and with it, I lostthe opportunity to see this plotand the opportunity to do my physics.It was a very strong transitionfor me in many ways.And professionally, it left mewithout a way to do my science.I longed to access and scrutinizethis energetic lightand figure out the astrophysical cause.I wanted to experiencethe spacious wonder, the excitement,the joy produced by the detectionof such a titanic celestial event. I thought long and hard about it,when I suddenly realizedthat all a light curve is,is a table of numbersconverted into a visual plot.So along with my collaborators,we worked really hard and we translatedthe numbers into sound.I achieved access to the data,and today I'm able to do physicsat the level of the best astronomer,using sound.And what people have been able to do,mainly visually,for hundreds of years,now I do it using sound. (Applause)Listening to this gamma-ray burstthat you're seeing on the —(Applause continues) Thank you. Listening to this burstthat you're seeing on the screenbrought something to the earbeyond the obvious burst.Now I'm going to play the burst for you.It's not music, it's sound. (Digital beeping sounds) This is scientific dataconverted into sound,and it's mapped in pitch.The process is called sonification. So listening to thisbrought something to the earbesides the obvious burst.When I examine the very stronglow-frequency regions,or bass line — I'm zoominginto the bass line now.We noted resonances characteristicof electrically charged gasseslike the solar wind.And I want you to hear what I heard.You will hear it as a very fastdecrease in volume.And because you're sighted,I'm giving you a red lineindicating what intensity of lightis being converted into sound. (Digital hum and whistling sound) The (Whistles) is frogs at home,don't pay attention to that. (Laughter) (Digital hum and whistling sound) I think you heard it, right? So what we foundis that the bursts last long enoughin order to support wave resonances,which are things caused by exchangesof energy between particlesthat may have been excited,that depend on the volume.You may remember that I saidthat the matter around the staris dragged around?It transmits power with frequencyand field distributiondetermined by the dimensions.You may remember that we were talkingabout a super-massive starthat became a very strongmagnetic field magnetar.If this is the case, then outflowsfrom the exploding starmay be associatedwith this gamma-ray burst. What does that mean?That star formationmay be a very important partof these supernova explosions.Listening to this very gamma-ray burstbrought us to the notionthat the use of soundas an adjunctive visual displaymay also support sighted astronomersin the search for moreinformation in the data.Simultaneously, I worked on analyzingmeasurements from other telescopes,and my experiments demonstratedthat when you use soundas an adjunctive visual display,astronomers can find more informationin this now more accessible data set.This ability to transform data into soundgives astronomy a tremendouspower of transformation.And the fact that a fieldthat is so visual may be improvedin order to include anyone with interestin understanding what lies in the heavensis a spirit-lifter. When I lost my sight,I noticed that I didn't have accessto the same amountand quality of informationa sighted astronomer had.It was not until we innovatedwith the sonification processthat I regained the hopeto be a productive member of the fieldthat I had worked so hard to be part of. Yet, information accessis not the only area in astronomywhere this is important.The situation is systemicand scientific fields are not keeping up.The body is something changeable —anyone may developa disability at any point.Let's think about, for example,scientists that are alreadyat the top of their careers.What happens to themif they develop a disability?Will they feel excommunicated as I did?Information accessempowers us to flourish.It gives us equal opportunitiesto display our talentsand choose what we wantto do with our lives,based on interest and not basedon potential barriers.When we give people the opportunityto succeed without limits,that will lead to personal fulfillmentand prospering life.And I think that the useof sound in astronomyis helping us to achieve thatand to contribute to science. While other countries told methat the study of perception techniquesin order to study astronomy datais not relevant to astronomybecause there are no blindastronomers in the field,South Africa said, \"We wantpeople with disabilitiesto contribute to the field.\"Right now, I'm workingat the South AfricanAstronomical Observatory,at the Office of Astronomyfor Development.There, we are working on sonificationtechniques and analysis methodsto impact the studentsof the Athlone School for the Blind.These students will be learningradio astronomy,and they will be learningthe sonification methodsin order to study astronomical eventslike huge ejections of energyfrom the sun, known ascoronal mass ejections.What we learn with these students —these students have multiple disabilitiesand coping strategiesthat will be accommodated —what we learn with these studentswill directly impactthe way things are being doneat the professional level.I humbly call this development.And this is happening right now. I think that science is for everyone.It belongs to the people,and it has to be available to everyone,because we are all natural explorers.I think that if we limit peoplewith disabilitiesfrom participating in science,we'll sever our links with historyand with society.I dream of a levelscientific playing field,where people encourage respectand respect each other,where people exchange strategiesand discover together.If people with disabilitiesare allowed into the scientific field,an explosion, a huge titanic burstof knowledge will take place,I am sure. (Digital beeping sounds) That is the titanic burst. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) Wanda Diaz Merced studies the light emitted by gamma-ray bursts, the most energetic events in the universe. When she lost her sight and was left without a way to do her science, she had a revelatory insight: the light curves she could no longer see could be translated into sound. Through sonification, she regained mastery over her work, and now she's advocating for a more inclusive scientific community. \"Science is for everyone,\" she says. \"It has to be available to everyone, because we are all natural explorers.\"nWhile searching for ways to study stellar radiation without relying on sight, Wanda Diaz Merced has developed a way to represent complex data about our universe as sound.

83	"What does it mean to spend our time well?I spend a lot of my timethinking about how to spend my time.Probably too much —I probably obsess over it.My friends think I do.But I feel like I kind of have to,because these days,it feels like little bits of my timekind of slip away from me,and when that happens, it feels likeparts of my life are slipping away. Specifically,it feels like little bitsof my time get slipped awayto various things like this,like technology — I check things.I'll give you an example.If this email shows up —how many of you have gottenan email like this, right?I've been tagged in a photo.When this appears,I can't help but click on it right now.Right? Because, like,what if it's a bad photo?So I have to click it right now.But I'm not just goingto click \"See photo,\"what I'm actually going to dois spend the next 20 minutes. (Laughter) But the worst part is that I knowthis is what's going to happen,and even knowingthat's what's going to happendoesn't stop mefrom doing it again the next time.Or I find myself in a situation like this,where I check my emailand I pull down to refresh,But the thing is that 60 seconds later,I'll pull down to refresh again.Why am I doing this?This doesn't make any sense. But I'll give you a hintwhy this is happening.What do you think makesmore money in the United Statesthan movies, game parksand baseball combined?Slot machines.How can slot machines make all this moneywhen we play with such smallamounts of money?We play with coins.How is this possible?Well, the thing is ...my phone is a slot machine.Every time I check my phone,I'm playing the slot machine to see,what am I going to get?What am I going to get?Every time I check my email,I'm playing the slot machine,saying, \"What am I going to get?\"Every time I scroll a news feed,I'm playing the slot machine to see,what am I going to get next?And the thing is that,again, knowing exactlyhow this works — and I'm a designer,I know exactly howthe psychology of this works,I know exactly what's going on —but it doesn't leave me with any choice,I still just get sucked into it. So what are we going to do?Because it leaves uswith this all-or-nothing relationshipwith technology, right?You're either on,and you're connectedand distracted all the time,or you're off,but then you're wondering,am I missing something important?In other words, you're either distractedor you have fear of missing out.Right? So we need to restore choice.We want to havea relationship with technologythat gives us back choiceabout how we spend time with it,and we're going to needhelp from designers,because knowing this stuff doesn't help.We're going to need design help.So what would that look like? So let's take an example that we all face:chat — text messaging.So let's say there's two people.Nancy's on the leftand she's working on a document,and John's on the right.And John suddenly remembers,\"I need to ask Nancyfor that document before I forget.\"So when he sends her that message,it blows away her attention. That's what we're doing all the time,bulldozing each other's attention,left and right.And there's serious cost to this,because every timewe interrupt each other,it takes us about 23 minutes, on average,to refocus our attention.We actually cycle throughtwo different projectsbefore we come backto the original thing we were doing.This is Gloria Mark's researchcombined with Microsoft research,that showed this.And her research also showsthat it actually trains bad habits.The more interruptions we get externally,it's conditioning and training usto interrupt ourselves.We actually self-interruptevery three-and-a-half minutes. This is crazy.So how do we fix this?Because Nancy and John are in thisall-or-nothing relationship.Nancy might want to disconnect,but then she'd be worried:What if I'm missing something important? Design can fix this problem.Let's say you haveNancy again on the left,John on the right.And John remembers,\"I need to send Nancy that document.\"Except this time,Nancy can mark that she's focused.Let's say she drags a slider and says,\"I want to be focused for 30 minutes,\"so — bam — she's focused.Now when John wants to message her,he can get the thought off of his mind —because he has a need,he has this thought,and he needs to dump it outbefore he forgets.Except this time,it holds the messagesso that Nancy can still focus,but John can get the thoughtoff of his mind. But this only worksif one last thing is true,which is that Nancy needs to knowthat if something is truly important,John can still interrupt.But instead of having constantaccidental or mindless interruptions,we're now only creatingconscious interruptions,nSo we're doing two things here.We're creating a new choicefor both Nancy and John,But there's a second, subtle thingwe're doing here, too.And it's that we're changingthe question we're answering.Instead of the goal of chat being:\"Let's design it so it's easyto send a message\" —that's the goal of chat,it should be really easy to senda message to someone —we change the goal to somethingdeeper and a human value,which is: \"Let's create the highestpossible quality communicationin a relationship between two people.So we upgraded the goal. Now, do designersactually care about this?Do we want to have conversationsabout what these deeper human goals are?Well, I'll tell you one story.A little over a year ago,I got to help organize a meetingbetween some of technology's leadingdesigners and Thich Nhat Hanh.Thich Nhat Hanh is an internationalspokesperson for mindfulness meditation.And it was the most amazing meeting.You have to imagine — picture a room —on one side of the room,you have a bunch of tech geeks;on the other side of the room,you have a bunch of long brown robes,shaved heads, Buddhist monks.And the questions were aboutthe deepest human values,like what does the futureof technology look likewhen you're designingfor the deepest questionsand the deepest human values?And our conversation centeredon listening more deeplyto what those values might be.He joked in our conversationthat what if, instead of a spell check,you had a compassion check,meaning, you might highlight a wordthat might be accidentally abrasive —perceived as abrasive by someone else. So does this kind of conversationhappen in the real world,not just in these design meetings?Well, the answer is yes,and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.If you didn't know,Couchsurfing is a websitethat matches peoplewho are looking for a place to staywith a free couch, from someonewho's trying to offer it. So, great service —what would their design goal be?What are you designingfor if you work at Couchsurfing?Well, you would thinkit's to match guests with hosts.Right?That's a pretty good goal.But that would kind of be likeour goal with messaging before,where we're just tryingto deliver a message. So what's the deeper, human goal?Well, they set their goalas the need to create lasting,positive experiences and relationshipsbetween people who've never met before.And the most amazing thingabout this was in 2007,they introduced a way to measure this,which is incredible.I'll tell you how it works.For every design goal you have,you have to havea corresponding measurementto know how you're doing —a way of measuring success.So what they do is,let's say you take two people who meet up,and they take the number of daysthose two people spent together,and then they estimate how manyhours were in those days —how many hours didthose two people spend together?And then after they spendthat time together,they ask both of them:How positive was your experience?Did you have a good experiencewith this person that you met?And they subtractfrom those positive hoursthe amount of timepeople spent on the website,because that's a cost to people's lives.Why should we value that as success?And what you were left withis something they refer to as \"netorchestrated conviviality,\"or, really, just a net\"Good Times\" created.The net hours that would have neverexisted, had Couchsurfing not existed. Can you imagine how inspiring it would beto come to work every dayand measure your successin the actual net new contributionof hours in people's livesthat are positive,that would have never existedif you didn't do what you wereabout to do at work today?Can you imagine a whole worldthat worked this way? Can you imagine a social network that —let's say you care about cooking,and it measured its successin terms of cooking nights organizedand the cooking articlesthat you were glad you read,and subtracted from that the articlesyou weren't glad you reador the time you spent scrollingthat you didn't like?Imagine a professional social networkthat, instead of measuring its successin terms of connections createdor messages sent,instead measured its success in termsof the job offers that people gotthat they were excited to get.And subtracted the amount of timepeople spent on the website.Or imagine dating services,like maybe Tinder or something,where instead of measuring the numberof swipes left and right people did,which is how they measure success today,instead measured the deep, romantic,fulfilling connections people created.Whatever that was for them, by the way. But can you imagine a whole worldthat worked this way,that was helping you spend your time well?Now to do this you also need a new system,because you're probably thinking,today's Internet economy —today's economy in general —is measured in time spent.The more users you have,the more usage you have,the more time people spend,that's how we measure success. But we've solved this problem before.We solved it with organic,when we said we needto value things a different way.We said this is a different kind of food.So we can't compare itjust based on price;this is a different category of food.We solved it with Leed Certification,where we said thisis a different kind of buildingthat stood for different valuesof environmental sustainability. What if we had somethinglike that for technology?What if we had somethingwhose entire purpose and goalwas to help create net new positivecontributions to human life?And what if we couldvalue it a different way,so it would actually work?Imagine you gave this differentpremium shelf space on app stores.Imagine you had web browsersthat helped route youto these kinds of design products.Can you imagine how exciting it would beto live and create that world? We can create this world today.Company leaders, all you have to do —only you can prioritize a new metric,which is your metric for net positivecontribution to human life.And have an honestconversation about that.Maybe you're notdoing so well to start with,but let's start that conversation. Designers, you can redefine success;you can redefine design.Arguably, you have more powerthan many people in your organizationto create the choicesthat all of us live by.Maybe like in medicine,where we have a Hippocratic oathto recognize the responsibilityand this higher valuethat we have to treat patients.What if designers had something like that,in terms of this new kind of design? And users, for all of us —we can demand technologythat works this way.Now it may seem hard,but McDonald's didn't have saladsuntil the consumer demand was there.Walmart didn't have organic fooduntil the consumer demand was there.We have to demandthis new kind of technology.And we can do that.And doing thatwould amount to shiftingfrom a world that's driven and runentirely on time spent,to world that's driven by time well spent. I want to live in this world,and I want this conversation to happen.Let's start that conversation now. Thank you. (Applause) How often does technology interrupt us from what we really mean to be doing? At work and at play, we spend a startling amount of time distracted by pings and pop-ups — instead of helping us spend our time well, it often feels like our tech is stealing it away from us.

84	"When I was a kid,I experienced something so powerful,I spent the rest of my lifesearching for it,and in all the wrong places.What I experienced wasn't virtual reality.It was music.And this is where the story begins. That's me,listening to the Beatles' \"White Album.\"And the look on my face is the feelingthat I've been searching for ever since.Music goes straight to the emotional vein,into your bloodstreamand right into your heart.It deepens every experience.Fellas? (Music) This is the amazing McKenzie Stubbertand Joshua Roman.Music —n(Applause) Yeah. Music makes everythinghave more emotional resonance.Let's see how it does for this talk.The right piece of musicat the right time fuses with uson a cellular level.When I hear that one songfrom that one summerwith that one girl,I'm instantly transportedback there again.Hey, Stacey. Here's a part of the story, though,where I got a little greedy.I thought if I added more layerson top of the music,I could make the feelingseven more powerful.So I got into directing music videos.This is what they looked like.That's my brother, Jeff.Sorry about this, Jeff. (Laughter) Here's me, just so we're even.Incredible moves.Should've been a dancer. (Laughter) These experiments grew,and in time, startedto look more like this.In both, I'm searchingfor the same thing, though,to capture that lightning in a bottle.Except, I'm not.Adding moving pictures over the musicadded narrative dimension, yes,but never quite equated the powerthat just raw music had for me on its own.This is not a great thing to realizewhen you've devoted your lifeand professional careerto becoming a music video director.I kept asking myself,did I take the wrong path?So I started thinking: if I couldinvolve you, the audience, more,I might be able to make youfeel something more as well. So Aaron Koblin and I beganauditioning new technologiesthat could put more of youinside of the work,like your childhood homein \"The Wilderness Downtown,\"your hand-drawn portraits,in \"The Johnny Cash Project,\"and your interactive dreamsin \"3 Dreams of Black.\"We were pushing beyond the screen,trying to connect more deeplyto people's hearts and imaginations.But it wasn't quite enough.It still didn't have the rawexperiential power of pure music for me. So I started chasing a new technologythat I only had read aboutin science fiction.And after years of searching,I found a prototype.It was a project from Nonny de la Peñain Mark Bolas's lab in USC.And when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.I could taste the lightning.It was called virtual reality.This was it five years agowhen I ran into it.This is what it looks like now. I quickly started building thingsin this new medium,and through that processwe realized something:that VR is going to playan incredibly important rolein the history of mediums.In fact, it's going to be the last one.I mean this because it's the first mediumthat actually makes the jumpfrom our internalizationof an author's expressionof an experience,to our experiencing it firsthand.You look confused.I'll explain. Don't worry. (Laughter) If we go back to the origins of mediums,by all best guesses,it starts around a fire,with a good story.Our clan leader is telling usabout how he hunted the woolly mammothon the tundra that day.We hear his wordsand translate theminto our own internal truths.The same thing happenswhen we look at the cave paintingversion of the story,the book about the mammoth hunt,the play,the radio broadcast,the television showor the movie.All of these mediums requirewhat we call \"suspension of disbelief,\"because there's a translation gapbetween the reality of the storyand our consciousnessinterpreting the storyinto our reality.I'm using the word \"consciousness\"as a feeling of reality that we getfrom our senses experiencingthe world around us. Virtual reality bridges that gap.Now, you are on the tundrahunting with the clan leader.Or you are the clan leader.Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth. (Laughter) So here's what special about VR.In all other mediums,your consciousness interprets the medium.In VR, your consciousness is the medium.So the potential for VR is enormous.But where are we now?What is the current state of the art?Well,we are here.We are the equivalentof year one of cinema.This is the Lumière Brothers filmthat allegedly sent a theater fullof people running for their livesas they thought a trainwas coming toward them.Similar to this early stageof this medium,in VR, we also have to movepast the spectacleand into the storytelling.It took this medium decadesto figure out its preferredlanguage of storytelling,in the form of a feature film.In VR today, we're more learning grammarthan writing language. We've made 15 films in the last yearat our VR company, Vrse,and we've learned a few things.We found that we have a unique,direct path into your senses,your emotions, even your body. So let me show you some things.For the purpose of this demo,we're going to take every directionthat you could possibly look,and stretch it into this giant rectangle.OK, here we go. So, first: camera movementis tricky in VR.Done wrong, it can actually make you sick.We found if you move the cameraat a constant speed in a straight line,you can actually get away with it, though.The first day in film school,they told me you have to learnevery single rulebefore you can break one.We have not learned every single rule.We've barely learned any at all,but we're already trying to break themto see what kind of creative thingswe can accomplish.In this shot here, where we're moving upoff the ground, I added acceleration.I did that because I wantedto give you a physical sensationof moving up off the ground.In VR, I can give that to you. (Music) Not surprisingly, music matters a lotin this medium as well.It guides us how to feel.In this project we madewith the New York Times, Zach Richterand our friend, JR,we take you up in a helicopter,and even though you're flying2,000 feet above Manhattan,you don't feel afraid.You feel triumphant for JR's character.The music guides you there. (Music) Contrary to popular belief,there is composition in virtual reality,but it's completelydifferent than in film,where you have a rectangular frame.Composition is nowwhere your consciousness existsand how the world moves around you.In this film, \"Waves of Grace,\"which was a collaboration between Vrse,the United Nations, Gabo Arora,and Imraan Ismail,we also see the changing roleof the close-up in virtual reality.A close-up in VR meansyou're actually close up to someone.It brings that character insideof your personal space,a space that we'd usually reservefor the people that we love.And you feel an emotionalcloseness to the characterbecause of what you feelto be a physical closeness. Directing VR is not likedirecting for the rectangle.It's more of a choreographyof the viewer's attention.One tool we can useto guide your attentionis called \"spatialized sound.\"I can put a sound anywherein front of you, to left or right,even behind you,and when you turn your head,the sound will rotate accordingly.So I can use that to direct your attentionto where I want you to see.Next time you hear someonesinging over your shoulder,it might be Bono. (Laughter) VR makes us feellike we are part of something.For most of human history,we lived in small family units.We started in caves,then moved to clans and tribes,then villages and towns,and now we're all global citizens.But I believe that we are stillhardwired to care the mostabout the things that are local to us.And VR makes anywhereand anyone feel local.That's why it works as an empathy machine.Our film \"Clouds Over Sidra\"takes you to a Syrian refugee camp,and instead of watching a storyabout people over there,it's now a story about us here. But where do we go from here?The tricky thing is thatwith all previous mediums,the format is fixed at its birth.Film has been a sequence of rectangles,from Muybridge and his horses to now.The format has never changed.But VR as a format, as a medium,isn't complete yet.It's not using physical celluloidor paper or TV signals.It actually employs what we useto make sense of the world.We're using your sensesas the paints on the canvas,but only two right now.Eventually, we can see if we will haveall of our human senses employed,and we will have agency to livethe story in any path we choose.And we call it virtual reality right now,but what happens when we movepast simulated realities?What do we call it then?What if instead of verballytelling you about a dream,I could let you live inside that dream?What if instead of just experiencingvisiting some reality on Earth,you could surf gravitational waveson the edge of a black hole,or create galaxies from scratch,or communicate with each othernot using wordsbut using our raw thoughts?That's not a virtual reality anymore.And honestly I don't knowwhat that's called.But I hope you see where we're going. But here I am, intellectualizinga medium I'm saying is experiential.So let's experience it.In your hands, you hopefully holda piece of cardboard.Let's open the flap.Tap on the power buttonto unlock the phone.For the people watching at home,we're going to put up a card right nowto show you how to downloadthis experience on your phone yourself,and even get a Google cardboardof your own to try it with.We played in cardboard boxes as kids,and as adults, I'm hoping we can all finda little bit of that lightningby sticking our head in one again.You're about to participatein the largest collectiveVR viewing in history.And in that classic old-timeystyle of yesteryear,we're all going to watch somethingat the exact same time, together.Let's hope it works.What's the countdownlook like? I can't see. Audience: ...15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9,8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1n(Birds singing) (Train engine) Audience: (Shreiks) (Video) JR: Let me tell youhow I shot the coverof the New York Times Magazine,\"Walking New York.\"I just got strapped onoutside the helicopter,and I had to be perfectlyvertical so I could grab it.And when I was perfectly above —you know, with the wind,we had to redo it a few times —then I kept shooting. (Video) Woman's voice: Dear Lord,protect us from evil,for you are the Lord,the light.You who gave us life took it away.Let your will be done.Please bring peace to the manywho have lost loved ones.Help us to live again. (Music) (Video) (Children's voices) Child's voice: There are more kidsin Zaatari than adults right now.Sometimes I thinkwe are the ones in charge. Chris Milk: How was it? (Applause) That was a cheap way of getting youto do a standing ovation.I just made you all stand.I knew you'd applaud at the end. (Applause) I believe that everyone on Earthneeds to experiencewhat you just experienced.That way we can collectivelystart to shape this,not as a tech platformbut as a humanity platform.And to that end, in November of last year,the New York Times and Vrse madea VR project called \"The Displaced.\"It launched with one millionGoogle Cardboardssent out to every Sunday subscriberwith their newspaper.But a funny thing happenedthat Sunday morning.A lot of people got themthat were not the intended recipientson the mailing label.And we started seeing thisall over Instagram.Look familiar? Music led me on a pathof searching for what seemedlike the unattainablefor a very long time.Now, millions of kids just hadthe same formative experiencein their childhoodthat I had in mine.Only I think this onesurpasses it.Let's seewhere thisleads them. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Milk uses innovative technologies to make personal, interactive, human stories. Accompanied by Joshua Roman on cello and McKenzie Stubbert on piano, Milk traces his relationship to music and art — from the first moment he remembers putting on headphones to his current work creating breakthrough virtual reality projects. VR is the last medium for storytelling, he says, because it closes the gap between audience and storyteller. To illustrate, he brought the TED audience together in the world's largest collective VR experience.

85	"I've got a confession.I love looking through people's garbage.Now, it's not some creepy thing.I'm usually just lookingfor old electronics,stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.Each one's got three different motors,so now you can build things that move.There's switches so you canturn things on and off.There's even a freaking laser,so you can make a cool robotinto an awesome robot. Now, I've builta lot of stuff out of garbage,and some of these thingshave even been kind of useful.But here's the thing,for me, garbage is just a chance to play,to be creative and build thingsto amuse myself.This is what I love doing,so I just made it part of my day job.I lead a university-basedbiological research lab,where we value curiosityand exploration above all else.We aren't focusedon any particular problem,and we're not trying to solveany particular disease.This is just a place where people can comeand ask fascinating questionsand find answers.And I realized a long time agothat if I challenge peopleto build the equipment they needout of the garbage I find,it's a great way to foster creativity.And what happenedwas that artists and scientistsfrom around the worldstarted coming to my lab.And it's not just becausewe value unconventional ideas,it's because we test and validate themwith scientific rigor. So one day I was hacking something,I was taking it apart,and I had this sudden idea:Could I treat biology like hardware?Could I dismantle a biological system,mix and match the partsand then put it back togetherin some new and creative way?My lab started working on this,and I want to show you the result. Can any of you guystell me what fruit this is? Audience: Apple!nAndrew Pelling:That's right — it's an apple.Now, I actually want you to notice as wellthat this is a lot redderthan most apples.And that's becausewe grew human cells into it.We took a totally innocentMacintosh apple,removed all the apple cells and DNAand then implanted human cells.And what we're left withafter removing all the apple cellsis this cellulose scaffold.This is the stuff that gives plantstheir shape and texture.And these little holes that you can see,this is where allthe apple cells used to be.So then we come along,we implant some mammalian cellsthat you can see in blue.What happens is,these guys start multiplyingand they fill up this entire scaffold. As weird as this is,it's actually really reminiscentof how our own tissues are organized.And we found in our pre-clinical workthat you can implantthese scaffolds into the body,and the body will send in cellsand a blood supplyand actually keep these things alive.This is the pointwhen people started asking me,\"Andrew, can you makebody parts out of apples?\"And I'm like, \"You've cometo the right place.\"n(Laughter) I actually brought this up with my wife.She's a musical instrument maker,and she does a lotof wood carving for a living.So I asked her,\"Could you, like,literally carve some earsout of an apple for us?\"And she did.So I took her ears to the lab.We then started preparing them.Yeah, I know. (Laughter) It's a good lab, man. (Laughter) And then we grew cells on them.And this is the result. Listen, my lab is notin the ear-manufacturing business.People have actually been workingon this for decades.Here's the issue:commercial scaffolds can bereally expensive and problematic,because they're sourcedfrom proprietary products,animals or cadavers.We used an apple and it cost pennies. What's also really cool hereis it's not that hardto make these things.The equipment you needcan be built from garbage,and the key processing steponly requires soap and water.So what we did was put allthe instructions online as open source.And then we foundeda mission-driven company,and we're developing kitsto make it easierfor anyone with a sinkand a soldering ironto make these things at home.What I'm really curiousabout is if one day,it will be possible to repair, rebuildand augment our own bodieswith stuff we make in the kitchen. Speaking of kitchens,here's some asparagus.They're tasty, and they makeyour pee smell funny. (Laughter) Now, I was in my kitchen,and I was noticingthat when you look downthe stalks of these asparagus,what you can seeare all these tiny little vessels.And when we image them in the lab,you can see how the celluloseforms these structures.This image reminds me of two things:our blood vesselsand the structure and organizationof our nerves and spinal cord. So here's the question:Can we grow axons and neuronsdown these channels?Because if we can,then maybe we can use asparagusto form new connectionsbetween the ends of damagedand severed nerves.Or maybe even a spinal cord.Don't get me wrong —this is exceptionally challengingand really hard work to do,and we are not the only onesworking on this.But we are the only ones using asparagus. (Laughter) Right now, we've gotreally promising pilot data.And we're working with tissue engineersand neurosurgeonsto find out what's actually possible. So listen, all of the work I've shown you,the stuff that I've builtthat's all around me on this stageand the other projectsmy lab is involved inare all a direct resultof me playing with your garbage.Play — play is a key partof my scientific practice.It's how I train my mindto be unconventional and to be creativeand to decide to make human apple ears. So, the next time any of youare looking at some old,broken-down, malfunctioning,piece-of-crap technology,I want you to think of me.Because I want it. (Laughter) Seriously, please find any wayto get in touch with me,and let's see what we can build. Thank you. (Applause) TED Fellow Andrew Pelling is a biohacker, and nature is his hardware. His favorite materials are the simplest ones (and oftentimes he finds them in the garbage). Building on the cellulose structure that gives an apple its shape, he \"grows\" lifelike human ears, pioneering a process that might someday be used to repair body parts safely and cheaply. And he has some even wilder ideas to share ... \"What I'm really curious about is if one day it will be possible to repair, rebuild and augment our own bodies with stuff we make in the kitchen,\" he says. Andrew Pelling's unconventional and creative scientific process is founded on play. Andrew Pelling's unconventional and creative scientific process is founded on play."
86	"I've been living in rural East Africafor about 10 years,and I want to share a field perspectivewith you on global poverty.I believe that the greatest failureof the human raceis the fact that we've left more thanone billion of our members behind.Hungry, extreme poverty:these often seem like gigantic,insurmountable problems,too big to solve.But as a field practitioner,I believe these are actuallyvery solvable problemsif we just take the right strategies. Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker,and he taught us that if we leanon the right levers,we can move the world.In the fight against extreme poverty,I believe there are three powerful leversthat we can lean on.This talk is all about those levers,and why they make povertya winnable fight in our lifetimes. What is extreme poverty?When I first moved to rural East Africa,I stayed overnight with a farm family.They were wonderful people.They invited me into their home.We sang songs togetherand ate a simple dinner.They gave me a blanketto sleep on the floor.In the morning, however,there was nothing to eat.And then at lunchtime, I watchedwith an increasingly sick feelingas the eldest girl in the familycooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.For that meal, every childdrank one cup to survive.And I cannot tell you how ashamed I feltwhen they handed one of those cups to me,and I knew I had to accepttheir hospitality. Children need food not only to survivebut also to grow physically and mentally.Every day they fail to eat,they lose a little bit of their future.Amongst the extreme poor,one in three childrenare permanently stuntedfrom a lifetime of not eating enough.When that's combinedwith poor access to health care,one in 10 extremely poor childrendie before they reach age five.And only one quarter of childrencomplete high schoolbecause they lack school fees.Hunger and extreme poverty curbhuman potential in every possible way.We see ourselves as a thinking,feeling and moral human race,but until we solve these problemsfor all of our members,we fail that standard,because every personon this planet matters.This child matters.These children matter.This girl matters. You know, we see things like this,and we're upset by them,but they seem like such big problems.We don't know howto take effective action.But remember our friend Archimedes.Global poverty has powerful levers.It's a problem like any other.I live and work in the field,and as a practitioner,I believe these are verysolvable problems.So for the next 10 minutes,let's not be sadabout the state of the world.Let's engage our brains.Let's engage our collective passionfor problem-solvingand figure out what those levers are. Lever number one: mostof the world's poor are farmers.Think about how extraordinary this is.If this picture representsthe world's poor,then more than half engage in farmingas a major source of income.This gets me really excited.All of these people, one profession.Think how powerful this is.When farmers become more productive,then more than half the world's poorearn more money and climb out of poverty.And it gets better.The product of farmingis, of course, food.So when farmers become more productive,they earn more food,and they don't just help themselves,but they help to feed healthy communitiesand thriving economies.And when farmers become more productive,they reduce environmental pressure.We only have two wayswe can feed the world:we can either make our existing farmlanda lot more productive,or we can clear cut forest and savannahto make more farmland,which would be environmentally disastrous.Farmers are basicallya really important leverage point.When farmers become more productive,they earn more income,they climb out of poverty,they feed their communities and theyreduce environmental land pressure.Farmers stand at the center of the world. And not a farmer like this one,but rather this lady.Most of the farmers I knoware actually women.Look at the strength and the willradiating from this woman.She is physically strong, mentally tough,and she will do whatever it takesto earn a better life for her children.If we're going to put the futureof humanity in one person's hands,then I'm really glad it's her. (Applause) There's just one problem:many smallholder farmerslack access to basic tools and knowledge.Currently, they take a little bitof saved food grain from the prior year,they plant it in the groundand they till it with a manual hand hoe.These are tools and techniquesthat date to the Bronze Age,and it's why many farmersare still very poor. But good news, again.Lever number two:humanity actually solved the problemof agricultural poverty a century ago.Let me walk you through the threemost basic factors in farming.First, hybrid seed is createdwhen you cross two seeds together.If you naturally pollinatea high-yielding varietytogether with a drought-resistant variety,you get a hybrid that inheritspositive traits from both of its parents.Next, conventional fertilizer,if used responsibly,is environmentally sustainable.If you micro-dosejust a pinch of fertilizerto a plant that's taller than I am,you unlock enormous yield gain.These are known as farm inputs.Farm inputs need to be combinedwith good practice.When you space your seedsand plant with massive amounts of compost,farmers multiply their harvests.These proven tools and practiceshave more than tripledagricultural productivityin every major region of the world,moving mass numbers of peopleout of poverty.We just haven't finished deliveringthese things to everybody just yet,particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. So overall, this is amazing news.Humanity actually solvedagricultural poverty a century ago,in theory.We just haven't delivered these thingsto everybody just yet.In this century, the reasonthat people remain pooris because maybe they livein remote places.They lack access to these things.Therefore, ending povertyis simply a matterof delivering proven goodsand services to people.We don't need more genius types right now.The humble delivery guy is goingto end global poverty in our lifetime. So these are the three levers,and the most powerful leveris simply delivery.Wherever the world's companies,governments and nonprofitsset up delivery networksfor life-improving goods,we eliminate poverty. OK, so that sounds really nice in theory,but what about in practice?What do these delivery networks look like?I want to share the concrete examplethat I know best,my organization, One Acre Fund.We only serve the farmer,and our job is to provide herwith the tools that she needs to succeed.We start off by delivering farm inputsto really rural places.Now, this may appearinitially very challenging,but it's pretty possible. Let me show you.We buy farm inputs with the combined powerof our farmer network,and store it in 20 warehouses like this.Then, during input delivery,we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucksand send them out to where farmersare waiting in the field.They then get their individual ordersand walk it home to their farms.It's kind of like Amazonfor rural farmers.Importantly, realistic deliveryalso includes finance, a way to pay.Farmers pay us little by little over time,covering most of our expenses.And then we surroundall that with training.Our rural field officersdeliver practical, hands-on trainingto farmers in the fieldevery two weeks. Wherever we deliver our services,farmers use these toolsto climb out of poverty.This is a farmerin our program, Consolata.Look at the pride on her face.She has achieved a modest prosperitythat I believe is the human rightof every hardworking person on the planet.Today, I'm proud to say that we're servingabout 400,000 farmers like Consolata. (Applause) The key to doing thisis scalable delivery.In any given area, we hirea rural field officerwho delivers our servicesto 200 farmers, on average,with more than 1,000 peopleliving in those families.Today, we have 2,000of these rural field officersgrowing very quickly.This is our delivery army,and we're just one organization.There are many companies,governments and nonprofitsthat have delivery armies just like this.And I believe we stand at a moment in timewhere collectively, we are capable ofdelivering farm services to all farmers. Let me show you how possible this is.This is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa,with a map of the United States for scale.I chose Sub-Saharan Africa becausethis is a huge delivery territory.It's very challenging.But we analyzed every 50-mileby 50-mile block on the continent,and we found that half of farmerslive in just these shaded regions.That's a remarkably small area overall.If you were to lay these boxesnext to each otherwithin a map of the United States,they would only coverthe Eastern United States.You can order pizzaanywhere in this territoryand it'll arrive to your househot, fresh and delicious.If America can deliver pizzato an area of this size,then Africa's companies,governments and non-profitscan deliver farm servicesto all of her farmers.This is possible. I'm going to wrap up by generalizingbeyond just farming.In every field of human development,humanity has already inventedeffective tools to end poverty.We just need to deliver them.So again, in every areaof human development,super-smart people a long time agoinvented inexpensive,highly effective tools.Humanity is armed to the teethwith simple, effectivesolutions to poverty.We just need to deliver theseto a pretty small area.Again using the mapof Sub-Saharan Africa as an example,remember that rural poverty isconcentrated in these blue shaded areas.Urban poverty is even more concentrated,in these green little dots.Again, using a mapof the United States for scale,this is what I would calla highly achievable delivery zone.In fact, for the first timein human history,we have a vast amount of deliveryinfrastructure available to us.The world's companies,governments and non-profitshave delivery armiesthat are fully capableof covering this relatively small area.We just lack the will. If we are willing,every one of us has a role to play.We first need more people to pursuecareers in human development,especially if you livein a developing nation.We need more front line health workers,teachers, farmer trainers,sales agents for life-improving goods.These are the delivery peoplethat dedicate their careersto improving the lives of others.But we also need a lot of support roles.These are roles availableat just my organization alone,and we're just one out of many.This may surprise you, but no matterwhat your technical specialty,there is a role for you in this fight.And no matter how logistically possibleit is to end poverty,we need a lot more resources.This is our number one constraint.For private investors, we needa big expansion of venture capital,private equity, working capital,available in emerging markets.But there are also limitsto what private business can accomplish.Private businesses often struggleto profitably serve the extreme poor,so philanthropy still hasa major role to play.Anybody can give,but we need more leadership.We need more visionary philanthropistsand global leaders who will takeproblems in human developmentand lead humanity to wipe themoff the face of the planet.If you're interested in these ideas,check out this website. We need more leaders.Humanity has put people on the moon.We've invented supercomputersthat fit into our pocketsand connect us with anybody on the planet.We've run marathonsat a five-minute mile pace.We are an exceptional people.But we've left more than one billionof our members behind.Until every girl like this onehas an opportunityto earn her full human potential,we have failed to becomea truly moral and just human race.Logistically speaking,it's incredibly possibleto end extreme poverty.We just need to deliverproven goods and servicesto everybody.If we have the will, every one of ushas a role to play.Let's deploy our time, our careers,our collective wealth.Let us deliver an end to extreme povertyin this lifetime. Thank you. (Applause) Half of the world's poorest people have something in common: they're small farmers. In this eye-opening talk, activist Andrew Youn shows how his group, One Acre Fund, is helping these farmers lift themselves out of poverty by delivering to them life-sustaining farm services that are already in use all over the world. Enter this talk believing we'll never be able to solve hunger and extreme poverty, and leave it with a new understanding of the scale of the world's biggest problems. With One Acre Fund, Andrew Youn is transforming African agriculture by helping farmers overcome the obstacles that hobble their harvests.

87	"The world is filledwith incredible objectsand rich cultural heritage.And when we get access to them,we are blown away, we fall in love.But most of the time,the world's population is livingwithout real access to arts and culture.What might the connections bewhen we start exploring our heritage,the beautiful locationsand the art in this world? Before we get startedin this presentation,I just want to take careof a few housekeeping points.First, I am no expert in art or culture.I fell into this by mistake,but I'm loving it.Secondly, all of whatI'm going to show youbelongs to the amazing museums,archives and foundationsthat we partner with.None of this belongs to Google.And finally, what you see behind meis available right nowon your mobile phones,on your laptops. This is our current platform,where you can explorethousands of museumsand objects at your fingertips,in extremely high-definition detail.The diversity of the contentis what's amazing.If we just had European paintings,if we just had modern art,I think it gets a bit boring.For example, this month,we launched the \"Black History\" channelwith 82 curated exhibitions,which talk about arts and culturein that community.We also have someamazing objects from Japan,centered around craftsmanship,called \"Made in Japan.\"And one of my favorite exhibitions,which actually is the idea of my talk,is — I didn't expect to becomea fan of Japanese dolls.But I am, thanks to this exhibition,that has really taught meabout the craftsmanshipbehind the soul of a Japanese doll.Trust me, it's very exciting.Take my word for it. So, moving on swiftly.One quick thing I wantedto showcase in this platform,which you can share with your kidsand your friends right now,is you can travel to all theseamazing institutions virtually, as well.One of our recent ideas was withThe Guggenheim Museum in New York,where you can get a tasteof what it might feel liketo actually be there.You can go to the ground floorand obviously, most of you,I assume, have been there.And you can see the architecturalmasterpiece that it is.But imagine this accessibilityfor a kid in Bombaywho's studying architecture,who hasn't had a chanceto go to The Guggenheim as yet.You can obviously look at objectsin the Guggenheim Museum,you can obviously get into themand so on and so forth.There's a lot of information here. But this is not the purposeof my talk today.This exists right now.What we now have are the building blocksto a very exciting future,when it comes to arts and cultureand accessibility to arts and culture.So I am joined today onstageby my good friend and artist in residenceat our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne,who is the professor of interactive designat ECAL Universityin Lausanne, Switzerland.What Cyril and our teamof engineers have been doingis trying to find these connectionsand visualize a few of these. So I'm going to go quite quick now.This object you seebehind me — oh, just clarification:Always, seeing the real thing is better.In case people thinkI'm trying to replicate the real thing.So, moving on.This object you see behind meis the Venus of Berekhat Ram.It's one of the oldestobjects in the world,found in the Golan Heightsaround 233,000 years ago,and currently residingat the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.It is also one of the oldestobjects on our platform. So let's zoom.We start from this one object.What if we zoomed outand actually tried to experienceour own cultural big bang?What might that look like?This is what we deal with on a daily basisat the Cultural Institute —over six million cultural artifactscurated and given to us by institutions,to actually make these connections.You can travel through time,you can understand moreabout our society through these.You can look at itfrom the perspective of our planet,and try to see howit might look without borders,if we just organized art and culture.We can also then plot it by time,which obviously, for the data geekin me, is very fascinating.You can spend hourslooking at every decadeand the contributionsin that decade and in those yearsfor art, history and cultures.We would love to spend hoursshowing you each and every decade,but we don't have the time right now.So you can go on your phoneand actually do it yourself. (Applause) But if you don't mindand can hold your applause till later,I don't want to run out of time,because I want to show youa lot of cool stuff. So, just very quickly:you can move on from hereto another very interesting idea.Beyond the pretty picture,beyond the nice visualization,what is the purpose, how is this useful?This next idea comesfrom discussions with curatorsthat we've been having at museums,who, by the way, I've fallen in love with,because they dedicate their whole lifeto try to tell these stories.One of the curators told me,\"Amit, what would it be likeif you could createa virtual curator's tablewhere all these six million objectsare displayed in a way for usto look at the connections between them?\"You can spend a lot of time, trust me,looking at different objectsand understanding where they come from.It's a crazy Matrix experience. (Laughter) Just moving on,let's take the world-famousVincent Van Gogh,who is very well-representedon this platform.Thanks to the diversityof the institutions we have,we have over 211 high-definition,amazing artworks by this artist,now organized in one beautiful view.And as it resolves,and as Cyril goes deeper,you can see all the self-portraits,you can see still life.But I just wanted to highlightone very quick example,which is very timely:\"The Bedroom.\"This is an artworkwhere three copies exist —one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,one at the Orsay in Parisand one at the Art Institute of Chicago,which, actually, currentlyis hosting a reunionof all three artworks physically,I think only for the second time ever.But, it is united digitally and virtuallyfor anybody to look atin a very different way,and you won't get pushedin the line in the crowd.So let's take you and let's travelthrough \"The Bedroom\" very quickly,so you can experience what we are doingfor every single object.We want the image to speakas much as it canon a digital platform.And all you need is an internetconnection and a computern(Applause) And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.I'm sorry, this is all live,so you have to give Cyrila little bit of —and this is available for every object:modern art, contemporary art,Renaissance — you name it,even sculpture. Sometimes, you don't knowwhat can attract youto an artwork or to a museumor to a cultural discovery.So for me, personally,it was quite a challengebecause when I decided to make thismy full-time job at Google,my mother was not very supportive.I love my mother,but she thought I was wasting my lifewith this museum stuff.And for her, a museum is whatyou do when you go on vacationand you tick-mark and it's over, right?And it took around four and a half yearsfor me to convince my lovely Indian motherthat actually, this is worthwhile.And the way I did it was,I realized one day that she loves gold.So I started showing her all objectsthat have the material gold in them.And the first thing my mom asks me is,\"How can we buy these?\"n(Laughter) And obviously, my salary is not that high,so I was like, \"We can'tactually do that, mom.But you can explore them virtually.\"And so now my mom — every timeI meet her, she asks me,\"Any more gold, any more silverin your project? Can you show me?\"And that's the ideaI'm trying to illustrate.It does not matter how you get in,as long as you get in.Once you get in, you're hooked. Moving on from here very quickly,there is kind of a playful idea, actually,to illustrate the point of access,and I'm going to goquite quickly on this one.We all know that seeing the artworkin person is amazing.But we also knowthat most of us can't do it,and the ones that can affordto do it, it's complicated.So — Cyril, can we loadup our art trip, what do we call it?We don't have a good name for this.But essentially, we havearound 1,000 amazing institutions,68 countries.But let's start with Rembrandt.We might have time for only one example.But thanks to the diversity,we've got around 500 amazingRembrandt object artworksfrom 46 institutions and 17 countries.Let's say that on your next vacation,you want to go seeevery single one of them.That is your itinerary,you will probably travel53,000 kilometers,visit around, I think, 46 institutions,and just FYI, you might release10 tons of CO2 emissions. (Laughter) But remember, it's art,so you can justify it,perhaps, in some way. Moving on swiftly from here,is something a little bitmore technical and more interesting.All that we've shown you so faruses metadata to make the connections.But obviously we havesomething cool nowadaysthat everyone likes to talk about,which is machine learning.So what we thought is,let's strip out all the metadata,let's look at what machine learning can dobased purely on visual recognitionof this entire collection.What we ended up withis this very interesting map,these clusters that haveno reference point information,but has just used visualsto cluster things together.Each cluster is an art to usby itself of discovery.But one of the clusters we wantto show you very quicklyis this amazing cluster of portraitsthat we found from museumsaround the world.If you could zoom ina little bit more, Cyril.Just to show you, you canjust travel through portraits.And essentially, you can do nature,you can do horsesand clusters galore. When we saw all these portraits,we were like, \"Hey, can we dosomething fun for kids,or can we do something playfulto get people interested in portraits?\"Because I haven't really seenyoung kids really excitedto go to a portrait gallery.I wanted to try to figure something out.So we created somethingcalled the portrait matcher.It's quite self-explanatory,so I'm just going to let Cyrilshow his beautiful face.And essentially what's happening is,with the movement of his head,we are matching different portraitsaround the world from museums. (Applause) And I don't know about you,but I've shown it to my nephew and sister,and the reaction is just phenomenal.All they ask me is,\"When can we go see this?\"And by the way, if we're nice,maybe, Cyril, you can smileand find a happy one?Oh, perfect.By the way, this is not rehearsed.Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow.OK, let's move on; otherwise,this will just take the whole time. (Applause) So, art and culturecan be fun also, right?For our last quick experiment —we call all of these \"experiments\" —our last quick experimentcomes back to machine learning.We show you clusters, visual clusters,but what if we could ask the machineto also name these clusters?What if it could automatically tagthem, using no actual metadata?So what we have is this kind of explorer,where we have managed to match,I think, around 4,000 labels.And we haven't reallydone anything special here,just fed the collection.And we found interesting categories.We can start with horses,a very straightforward category.You would expect to seethat the machine has putimages of horses, right?And it has, but you also notice,right over there,that it has a very abstract imagethat it has still managed to recognizeand cluster as horses.We also have an amazing headin terms of a horse.And each one has the tagsas to why it got categorized in this. So let's move to another onewhich I found very funny and interesting,because I don't understandhow this category came up.It's called \"Lady in Waiting.\"If, Cyril, you do it very quickly,you will see that we havethese amazing imagesof ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.I don't really understand it.But I've been trying to askmy museum contacts,you know, \"What is this?What's going on here?\"And it's fascinating. Coming back to gold very quickly,I wanted to search for goldand see how the machinetagged all the gold.But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.We are living in popular times.It tags it as \"bling-bling.\"n(Laughter) I'm being hard on Cyril,because I'm moving too fast.Essentially, here you haveall the bling-blingof the world's museums organized for you. And finally, to end this talkand these experiments,what I hope you feel after this talkis happiness and emotion.And what would we seewhen we see happiness?If we actually look at all the objectsthat have been tagged under \"happiness,\"you would expect happiness, I guess.But there was one that came upthat was very fascinating and interesting,which was this artworkby Douglas Coupland,our friend and artistin residence as well,called, \"I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain.\"I don't know why the machine feels likeit misses its pre-Internet brainand it's been tagged here,but it's a very interesting thought.I sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain,but not when it comes to exploringarts and culture online. So take out your phones,take out your computers,go visit museums.And just a quick call-outto all the amazing archivists,historians, curators,who are sitting in museums,preserving all this culture.And the least we can do is getour daily dose of art and culturefor ourselves and our kids. Thank you. (Applause) What does a cultural Big Bang look like?

88	"What is it that French peopledo better than all the others?If you would take polls,the top three answers might be:love, wine and whining. (Laughter) Maybe.But let me suggest a fourth one:mathematics.Did you know that Parishas more mathematiciansthan any other city in the world?And more streetswith mathematicians' names, too.And if you look at the statisticsof the Fields Medal,often called the Nobel Prizefor mathematics,and always awarded to mathematiciansbelow the age of 40,you will find that France has moreFields medalists per inhabitantthan any other country. What is it that we find so sexy in math?After all, it seems to bedull and abstract,just numbers and computationsand rules to apply.Mathematics may be abstract,but it's not dulland it's not about computing.It is about reasoningand proving our core activity.It is about imagination,the talent which we most praise.It is about finding the truth.There's nothing like the feelingwhich invades youwhen after months of hard thinking,you finally understand the rightreasoning to solve your problem.The great mathematicianAndré Weil likened this —no kidding —to sexual pleasure.But noted that this feelingcan last for hours, or even days. The reward may be big.Hidden mathematical truthspermeate our whole physical world.They are inaccessible to our sensesbut can be seenthrough mathematical lenses.Close your eyes for momentand think of what is occurringright now around you.Invisible particles from the airaround are bumping on youby the billions and billionsat each second,all in complete chaos.And still,their statistics can be accuratelypredicted by mathematical physics.And open your eyes nowto the statistics of the velocitiesof these particles. The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve,or the Law of Errors —of deviations with respectto the mean behavior.This curve tells about the statisticsof velocities of particlesin the same way as a demographic curvewould tell about the statisticsof ages of individuals.It's one of the mostimportant curves ever.It keeps on occurring again and again,from many theories and many experiments,as a great example of the universalitywhich is so dear to us mathematicians. Of this curve,the famous scientist Francis Galton said,\"It would have been deified by the Greeksif they had known it.It is the supreme law of unreason.\"And there's no better way to materializethat supreme goddess than Galton's Board.Inside this board are narrow tunnelsthrough which tiny ballswill fall down randomly,going right or left, or left, etc.All in complete randomness and chaos.Let's see what happens when we lookat all these random trajectories together. (Board shaking) This is a bit of a sport,because we need to resolvesome traffic jams in there.Aha.We think that randomnessis going to play me a trick on stage. There it is.Our supreme goddess of unreason.the Gauss Curve,trapped here inside this transparent boxas Dream in \"The Sandman\" comics.For you I have shown it,but to my students I explain whyit could not be any other curve.And this is touchingthe mystery of that goddess,replacing a beautiful coincidenceby a beautiful explanation. All of science is like this.And beautiful mathematical explanationsare not only for our pleasure.They also change our vision of the world.For instance,Einstein,Perrin,Smoluchowski,they used the mathematical analysisof random trajectoriesand the Gauss Curveto explain and prove that ourworld is made of atoms. It was not the first timethat mathematics was revolutionizingour view of the world.More than 2,000 years ago,at the time of the ancient Greeks,it already occurred.In those days,only a small fraction of the worldhad been explored,and the Earth might have seemed infinite.But clever Eratosthenes,using mathematics,was able to measure the Earthwith an amazing accuracy of two percent. Here's another example.In 1673, Jean Richer noticedthat a pendulum swings slightlyslower in Cayenne than in Paris.From this observation alone,and clever mathematics,Newton rightly deducedthat the Earth is a wee bitflattened at the poles,like 0.3 percent —so tiny that you wouldn't evennotice it on the real view of the Earth. These stories show that mathematicsis able to make us go out of our intuitionmeasure the Earth which seems infinite,see atoms which are invisibleor detect an imperceptiblevariation of shape.And if there is just one thing that youshould take home from this talk,it is this:mathematics allows usto go beyond the intuitionand explore territorieswhich do not fit within our grasp. Here's a modern exampleyou will all relate to:searching the Internet.The World Wide Web,more than one billion web pages —do you want to go through them all?Computing power helps,but it would be useless withoutthe mathematical modelingto find the informationhidden in the data. Let's work out a baby problem.Imagine that you're a detectiveworking on a crime case,and there are many peoplewho have their version of the facts.Who do you want to interview first?Sensible answer:prime witnesses.You see,suppose that there is person number seven,tells you a story,but when you ask where he got if from,he points to personnumber three as a source.And maybe person number three, in turn,points at person number oneas the primary source.Now number one is a prime witness,so I definitely wantto interview him — priority.And from the graphwe also see that personnumber four is a prime witness.And maybe I even wantto interview him first,because there are morepeople who refer to him. OK, that was easy,but now what about if you havea big bunch of people who will testify?And this graph,I may think of it as all peoplewho testify in a complicated crime case,but it may just as well be web pagespointing to each other,referring to each other for contents.Which ones are the most authoritative?Not so clear. Enter PageRank,one of the early cornerstones of Google.This algorithm uses the lawsof mathematical randomnessto determine automaticallythe most relevant web pages,in the same way as we used randomnessin the Galton Board experiment.So let's send into this grapha bunch of tiny, digital marblesand let them go randomlythrough the graph.Each time they arrive at some site,they will go out through some linkchosen at random to the next one.And again, and again, and again.And with small, growing piles,we'll keep the record of how manytimes each site has been visitedby these digital marbles. Here we go.Randomness, randomness.And from time to time,also let's make jumps completelyrandomly to increase the fun. And look at this:from the chaos will emerge the solution.The highest pilescorrespond to those siteswhich somehow are betterconnected than the others,more pointed at than the others.And here we see clearlywhich are the web pageswe want to first try.Once again,the solution emerges from the randomness.Of course, since that time,Google has come up with much moresophisticated algorithms,but already this was beautiful. And still,just one problem in a million.With the advent of digital area,more and more problems lendthemselves to mathematical analysis,making the job of mathematiciana more and more useful one,to the extent that a few years ago,it was ranked number oneamong hundreds of jobsin a study about the best and worst jobspublished by the Wall StreetJournal in 2009. Mathematician —best job in the world.That's because of the applications:communication theory,information theory,game theory,compressed sensing,machine learning,graph analysis,harmonic analysis.And why not stochastic processes,linear programming,or fluid simulation?Each of these fields havemonster industrial applications.And through them,there is big money in mathematics.And let me concedethat when it comes to makingmoney from the math,the Americans are by a long shotthe world champions,with clever, emblematic billionairesand amazing, giant companies,all resting, ultimately,on good algorithm. Now with all this beauty,usefulness and wealth,mathematics does look more sexy.But don't you thinkthat the life a mathematicalresearcher is an easy one.It is filled with perplexity,frustration,a desperate fight for understanding. Let me evoke for youone of the most striking daysin my mathematician's life.Or should I say,one of the most striking nights.At that time,I was staying at the Institutefor Advanced Studies in Princeton —for many years, the homeof Albert Einsteinand arguably the most holy placefor mathematical research in the world.And that night I was workingand working on an elusive proof,which was incomplete.It was all about understandingthe paradoxical stabilityproperty of plasmas,which are a crowd of electrons.In the perfect world of plasma,there are no collisionsand no friction to providethe stability like we are used to.But still,if you slightly perturba plasma equilibrium,you will find that theresulting electric fieldspontaneously vanishes,or damps out,as if by some mysterious friction force. This paradoxical effect,called the Landau damping,is one of the most importantin plasma physics,and it was discoveredthrough mathematical ideas.But still,a full mathematical understandingof this phenomenon was missing.And together with my former studentand main collaborator Clément Mouhot,in Paris at the time,we had been working for monthsand months on such a proof.Actually,I had already announced by mistakethat we could solve it.But the truth is,the proof was just not working.In spite of more than 100 pagesof complicated, mathematical arguments,and a bunch discoveries,and huge calculation,it was not working.And that night in Princeton,a certain gap in the chain of argumentswas driving me crazy.I was putting in there all my energyand experience and tricks,and still nothing was working.1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,not working.Around 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits.Then a few hours later,waking up and go,\"Ah, it's time to getthe kids to school —\"What is this?There was this voice in my head, I swear.\"Take the second term to the other side,Fourier transform and invert in L2.\"n(Laughter) Damn it,that was the start of the solution!nYou see,I thought I had taken some rest,but really my brain hadcontinued to work on it.In those moments,you don't think of your careeror your colleagues,it's just a complete battlebetween the problem and you. That being said,it does not harm when you do geta promotion in reward for your hard work.And after we completed our hugeanalysis of the Landau damping,I was lucky enoughto get the most coveted Fields Medalfrom the hands of the President of India,in Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 —an honor that mathematiciansnever dare to dream,a day that I will remember until I live. What do you think,on such an occasion?Pride, yes?And gratitude to the many collaboratorswho made this possible.And because it was a collective adventure,you need to share it,not just with your collaborators.I believe that everybody can appreciatethe thrill of mathematical research,and share the passionate storiesof humans and ideas behind it.And I've been working with my staffat Institut Henri Poincaré,together with partners and artistsof mathematical communication worldwide,so that we can found our own,very special museum of mathematics there. So in a few years,when you come to Paris,after tasting the great, crispybaguette and macaroon,please come and visit usat Institut Henri Poincaré,and share the mathematical dream with us. Thank you.

90	"By raising your hand,how many of you knowat least one person on the screen?Wow, it's almost a full house.It's true, they are very famousin their fields.And do you know whatall of them have in common?They all died of pancreatic cancer.However, although it's very,very sad this news,it's also thanks to their personal storiesthat we have raised awarenessof how lethal this disease can be. It's become the third causeof cancer deaths,and only eight percent of the patientswill survive beyond five years.That's a very tiny number,especially if you compare itwith breast cancer,where the survival rateis almost 90 percent.So it doesn't really come as a surprisethat being diagnosedwith pancreatic cancermeans facing an almostcertain death sentence.What's shocking, though,is that in the last 40 years,this number hasn't changed a bit,while much more progress has been madewith other types of tumors.So how can we make pancreatic cancertreatment more effective?As a biomedical entrepreneur,I like to work on problemsthat seem impossible,understanding their limitationsand trying to find new,innovative solutionsthat can change their outcome. The first piece of bad newswith pancreatic canceris that your pancreas is in the middleof your belly, literally.It's depicted in orange on the screen.But you can barely see ituntil I remove all the otherorgans in front.It's also surroundedby many other vital organs,like the liver, the stomach,the bile duct.And the ability of the tumorto grow into those organsis the reason why pancreatic canceris one of the most painful tumor types.The hard-to-reach locationalso prevents the doctorfrom surgically removing it,as is routinely donefor breast cancer, for example.So all of these reasons leavechemotherapy as the only optionfor the pancreatic cancer patient. This brings us to the secondpiece of bad news.Pancreatic cancer tumors havevery few blood vessels.Why should we careabout the blood vessel of a tumor?Let's think for a secondhow chemotherapy works.The drug is injected in the veinand it navigates throughout the bodyuntil it reaches the tumor site.It's like driving on a highway,trying to reach a destination.But what if your destinationdoesn't have an exit on the highway?You will never get there.And that's exactly the same problemfor chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.The drugs navigatethroughout all of your body.They will reach healthy organs,resulting in high toxic effectfor the patients overall,but very little will go to the tumor.Therefore, the efficacy is very limited. To me, it seems very counterintuitiveto have a whole-body treatmentto target a specific organ.However, in the last 40 years,a lot of money, researchand effort have gone towardsfinding new, powerful drugsto treat pancreatic cancer,but nothing has been donein changing the waywe deliver them to the patient. So after two pieces of bad news,I'm going to give yougood news, hopefully.With a collaborator at MITand the MassachusettsGeneral Hospital in Boston,we have revolutionizedthe way we treat cancerby making localizeddrug delivery a reality.We are basically parachuting youon top of your destination,avoiding your having to driveall around the highway.We have embedded the druginto devices that look like this one.They are flexible enoughthat they can be foldedto fit into the catheter,so the doctor can implant itdirectly on top of the tumorwith minimally invasive surgery.But they are solid enoughthat once they are positionedon top of the tumor,they will act as a cage.They will actuallyphysically prevent the tumorfrom entering other organs,controlling the metastasis. The devices are also biodegradable.That means that once in the body,they start dissolving,delivering the drug only locally,slowly and more effectivelythan what is done with the currentwhole-body treatment.In pre-clinical study,we have demonstratedthat this localized approachis able to improve by 12 timesthe response to treatment. So we took a drug that is already knownand by just delivering it locallywhere it's needed the most,we allow a responsethat is 12 times more powerful,reducing the systemic toxic effect.We are working relentlessly to bringthis technology to the next level.We are finalizing the pre-clinical testingand the animal model requiredprior to asking the FDA for approvalfor clinical trials. Currently, the majority of patientswill die from pancreatic cancer.We are hoping that one day,we can reduce their pain,extend their lifeand potentially make pancreatic cancera curable disease. By rethinking the way we deliver the drug,we don't only make itmore powerful and less toxic,we are also opening the doorto finding new innovative solutionsfor almost all other impossible problemsin pancreatic cancer patients and beyond. Thank you very much. (Applause) Anyone who has lost a loved one to pancreatic cancer knows the devastating speed with which it can affect an otherwise healthy person. TED Fellow and biomedical entrepreneur Laura Indolfi is developing a revolutionary way to treat this complex and lethal disease: a drug delivery device that acts as a cage at the site of a tumor, preventing it from spreading and delivering medicine only where it's needed. \"We are hoping that one day we can make pancreatic cancer a curable disease,\" she says. Laura Indolfi is revolutionizing cancer treatment with new technologies including implantable devices for delivering drugs locally to the site of a tumor.

91	"In the space that usedto house one transistor,we can now fit one billion.That made it so that a computerthe size of an entire roomnow fits in your pocket.You might say the future is small. As an engineer,I'm inspired by this miniaturizationrevolution in computers.As a physician,I wonder whether we could use itto reduce the number of lives lostdue to one of the fastest-growingdiseases on Earth:cancer.Now when I say that,what most people hear me sayis that we're working on curing cancer.And we are.But it turns outthat there's an incredibleopportunity to save livesthrough the early detectionand prevention of cancer. Worldwide, over two-thirds of deathsdue to cancer are fully preventableusing methods that we alreadyhave in hand today.Things like vaccination, timely screeningand of course, stopping smoking.But even with the best toolsand technologies that we have today,some tumors can't be detecteduntil 10 years afterthey've started growing,when they are 50 millioncancer cells strong.What if we had better technologiesto detect some of these moredeadly cancers sooner,when they could be removed,when they were just getting started? Let me tell you about howminiaturization might get us there.This is a microscope in a typical labthat a pathologist would usefor looking at a tissue specimen,like a biopsy or a pap smear.This $7,000 microscopewould be used by somebodywith years of specialized trainingto spot cancer cells.This is an image from a colleagueof mine at Rice University,Rebecca Richards-Kortum.What she and her team have doneis miniaturize that whole microscopeinto this $10 part,and it fits on the endof an optical fiber.Now what that means is insteadof taking a sample from a patientand sending it to the microscope,you can bring the microscopeto the patient.And then, instead of requiringa specialist to look at the images,you can train the computer to scorenormal versus cancerous cells. Now this is important,because what they foundworking in rural communities,is that even when they havea mobile screening vanthat can go out into the communityand perform examsand collect samplesand send them to the centralhospital for analysis,that days later,women get a callwith an abnormal test resultand they're asked to come in.Fully half of them don't turn upbecause they can't afford the trip.With the integrated microscopeand computer analysis,Rebecca and her colleagueshave been able to create a vanthat has both a diagnostic setupand a treatment setup.And what that meansis that they can do a diagnosisand perform therapy on the spot,so no one is lost to follow up. That's just one example of howminiaturization can save lives.Now as engineers,we think of thisas straight-up miniaturization.You took a big thingand you made it little.But what I told you before about computerswas that they transformed our liveswhen they became small enoughfor us to take them everywhere.So what is the transformationalequivalent like that in medicine?Well, what if you had a detectorthat was so small that it couldcirculate in your body,find the tumor all by itselfand send a signal to the outside world?It sounds a little bitlike science fiction.But actually, nanotechnologyallows us to do just that.Nanotechnology allows us to shrinkthe parts that make up the detectorfrom the width of a human hair,which is 100 microns,to a thousand times smaller,which is 100 nanometers.And that has profound implications. It turns out that materialsactually change their propertiesat the nanoscale.You take a common material like gold,and you grind it into dust,into gold nanoparticles,and it changes from lookinggold to looking red.If you take a more exotic materiallike cadmium selenide —forms a big, black crystal —if you make nanocrystalsout of this materialand you put it in a liquid,and you shine light on it,they glow.And they glow blue, green,yellow, orange, red,depending only on their size.It's wild! Can you imagine an objectlike that in the macro world?It would be like all the denim jeansin your closet are all made of cotton,but they are different colorsdepending only on their size. (Laughter) So as a physician,what's just as interesting to meis that it's not justthe color of materialsthat changes at the nanoscale;the way they travelin your body also changes.And this is the kind of observationthat we're going to useto make a better cancer detector. So let me show you what I mean.This is a blood vessel in the body.Surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.We're going to inject nanoparticlesinto the blood vesseland watch how they travelfrom the bloodstream into the tumor.Now it turns out that the blood vesselsof many tumors are leaky,and so nanoparticles can leak outfrom the bloodstream into the tumor.Whether they leak outdepends on their size.So in this image,the smaller, hundred-nanometer,blue nanoparticles are leaking out,and the larger, 500-nanometer,red nanoparticlesare stuck in the bloodstream.So that means as an engineer,depending on how bigor small I make a material,I can change where it goes in your body. In my lab, we recently madea cancer nanodetectorthat is so small that it could travelinto the body and look for tumors.We designed it to listenfor tumor invasion:the orchestra of chemical signalsthat tumors need to make to spread.For a tumor to break outof the tissue that it's born in,it has to make chemicals called enzymesto chew throughthe scaffolding of tissues.We designed these nanoparticlesto be activated by these enzymes.One enzyme can activate a thousandof these chemical reactions in an hour.Now in engineering, we callthat one-to-a-thousand ratioa form of amplification,and it makes something ultrasensitive.So we've made an ultrasensitivecancer detector. OK, but how do I get this activatedsignal to the outside world,where I can act on it?For this, we're going to useone more piece of nanoscale biology,and that has to do with the kidney.The kidney is a filter.Its job is to filter out the bloodand put waste into the urine.It turns out that what the kidney filtersis also dependent on size.So in this image, what you can seeis that everything smallerthan five nanometersis going from the blood,through the kidney, into the urine,and everything elsethat's bigger is retained.OK, so if I make a 100-nanometercancer detector,I inject it in the bloodstream,it can leak into the tumorwhere it's activated by tumor enzymesto release a small signalthat is small enough to befiltered out of the kidneyand put into the urine,I have a signal in the outside worldthat I can detect. OK, but there's one more problem.This is a tiny little signal,so how do I detect it?Well, the signal is just a molecule.They're moleculesthat we designed as engineers.They're completely synthetic,and we can design themso they are compatiblewith our tool of choice.If we want to use a reallysensitive, fancy instrumentcalled a mass spectrometer,then we make a moleculewith a unique mass.Or maybe we want make somethingthat's more inexpensive and portable.Then we make moleculesthat we can trap on paper,like a pregnancy test.In fact, there's a wholeworld of paper teststhat are becoming availablein a field called paper diagnostics. Alright, where are we going with this?What I'm going to tell you next,as a lifelong researcher,represents a dream of mine.I can't say that's it's a promise;it's a dream.But I think we all have to have dreamsto keep us pushing forward,even — and maybe especially —cancer researchers. I'm going to tell you what I hopewill happen with my technology,that my team and I will putour hearts and soulsinto making a reality.OK, here goes.I dream that one day,instead of going intoan expensive screening facilityto get a colonoscopy,or a mammogram,or a pap smear,that you could get a shot,wait an hour,and do a urine test on a paper strip.I imagine that this could even happenwithout the need for steady electricity,or a medical professional in the room.Maybe they could be far awayand connected only by the imageon a smartphone. Now I know this sounds like a dream,but in the lab we alreadyhave this working in mice,where it works betterthan existing methodsfor the detection of lung,colon and ovarian cancer.And I hope that what this meansis that one day we candetect tumors in patientssooner than 10 yearsafter they've started growing,in all walks of life,all around the globe,and that this would leadto earlier treatments,and that we could save more livesthan we can today,with early detection. Thank you. (Applause) What if we could find cancerous tumors years before they can harm us — without expensive screening facilities or even steady electricity?

92	"So this is a talk about gene drives,but I'm going to startby telling you a brief story.20 years ago, a biologistnamed Anthony Jamesgot obsessed with the ideaof making mosquitosthat didn't transmit malaria. It was a great idea,and pretty much a complete failure.For one thing, it turned outto be really hardto make a malaria-resistant mosquito.James managed it, finally,just a few years ago,by adding some genesthat make it impossiblefor the malaria parasiteto survive inside the mosquito. But that just created another problem.Now that you've gota malaria-resistant mosquito,how do you get it to replaceall the malaria-carrying mosquitos?There are a couple options,but plan A was basically to breed upa bunch of the newgenetically-engineered mosquitosrelease them into the wildand hope that they pass on their genes.The problem was that you'd have to releaseliterally 10 times the numberof native mosquitos to work.So in a village with 10,000 mosquitos,you release an extra 100,000.As you might guess,this was not a very popular strategywith the villagers. (Laughter) Then, last January,Anthony James got an emailfrom a biologist named Ethan Bier.Bier said that heand his grad student Valentino Gantzhad stumbled on a toolthat could not only guaranteethat a particular genetic traitwould be inherited,but that it would spreadincredibly quickly.If they were right,it would basically solve the problemthat he and James had beenworking on for 20 years. As a test, they engineered two mosquitosto carry the anti-malaria geneand also this new tool, a gene drive,which I'll explain in a minute.Finally, they set it upso that any mosquitosthat had inherited the anti-malaria genewouldn't have the usual white eyes,but would instead have red eyes.That was pretty much just for convenienceso they could tell just at a glancewhich was which. So they took their twoanti-malarial, red-eyed mosquitosand put them in a boxwith 30 ordinary white-eyed ones,and let them breed.In two generations, those had produced3,800 grandchildren.That is not the surprising part.This is the surprising part:given that you startedwith just two red-eyed mosquitosand 30 white-eyed ones,you expect mostly white-eyed descendants.Instead, when James opened the box,all 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes. When I asked Ethan Bier about this moment,he became so excited that he was literallyshouting into the phone.That's because gettingonly red-eyed mosquitosviolates a rule that is the absolutecornerstone of biology,Mendelian genetics.I'll keep this quick,but Mendelian geneticssays when a male and a female mate,their baby inherits halfof its DNA from each parent.So if our original mosquito was aaand our new mosquito is aB,where B is the anti-malarial gene,the babies should come outin four permutations:aa, aB, aa, Ba.Instead, with the new gene drive,they all came out aB.Biologically, that shouldn'teven be possible. So what happened?The first thing that happenedwas the arrival of a gene-editing toolknown as CRISPR in 2012.Many of you have probablyheard about CRISPR,so I'll just say briefly that CRISPRis a tool that allows researchersto edit genes very precisely,easily and quickly.It does this by harnessing a mechanismthat already existed in bacteria.Basically, there's a proteinthat acts like a scissorsand cuts the DNA,and there's an RNA moleculethat directs the scissorsto any point on the genome you want.The result is basicallya word processor for genes.You can take an entire geneout, put one in,or even edit just a singleletter within a gene.And you can do it in nearly any species. OK, remember how I said that gene drivesoriginally had two problems?The first was that it was hardto engineer a mosquitoto be malaria-resistant.That's basically gone now,thanks to CRISPR.But the other problem was logistical.How do you get your trait to spread?This is where it gets clever. A couple years ago, a biologistat Harvard named Kevin Esveltwondered what would happenif you made it so thatCRISPR inserted not only your new genebut also the machinerythat does the cutting and pasting.In other words, what if CRISPRalso copied and pasted itself.You'd end up with a perpetualmotion machine for gene editing.And that's exactly what happened.This CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt creatednot only guaranteesthat a trait will get passed on,but if it's used in the germline cells,it will automatically copy and pasteyour new geneinto both chromosomesof every single individual.It's like a global search and replace,or in science terms, it makesa heterozygous trait homozygous. So, what does this mean?For one thing, it means we havea very powerful,but also somewhat alarming new tool.Up until now, the fact that gene drivesdidn't work very wellwas actually kind of a relief.Normally when we mess aroundwith an organism's genes,we make that thingless evolutionarily fit.So biologists can makeall the mutant fruit flies they wantwithout worrying about it.If some escape, natural selectionjust takes care of them. What's remarkable and powerfuland frightening about gene drivesis that that will no longer be true.Assuming that your trait does not havea big evolutionary handicap,like a mosquito that can't fly,the CRISPR-based gene drivewill spread the change relentlesslyuntil it is in every single individualin the population.Now, it isn't easy to makea gene drive that works that well,but James and Esvelt think that we can. The good news is that this opensthe door to some remarkable things.If you put an anti-malarial gene drivein just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes,the species that transmits malaria,researchers estimate that it would spreadto the entire population in a year.So in a year, you could virtuallyeliminate malaria.In practice, we're still a few years outfrom being able to do that,but still, a 1,000 childrena day die of malaria.In a year, that numbercould be almost zero.The same goes for dengue fever,chikungunya, yellow fever. And it gets better.Say you want to get ridof an invasive species,like get Asian carpout of the Great Lakes.All you have to do is release a gene drivethat makes the fish produceonly male offspring.In a few generations,there'll be no females left, no more carp.In theory, this means we could restorehundreds of native speciesthat have been pushed to the brink. OK, that's the good news,this is the bad news.Gene drives are so effectivethat even an accidental releasecould change an entire species,and often very quickly.Anthony James took good precautions.He bred his mosquitosin a bio-containment laband he also used a speciesthat's not native to the USso that even if some did escape,they'd just die off, there'd be nothingfor them to mate with.But it's also true that if a dozenAsian carp with the all-male gene driveaccidentally got carriedfrom the Great Lakes back to Asia,they could potentially wipe outthe native Asian carp population.And that's not so unlikely,given how connected our world is.In fact, it's why we havean invasive species problem.And that's fish.Things like mosquitos and fruit flies,there's literally no way to contain them.They cross bordersand oceans all the time. OK, the other piece of bad newsis that a gene drivemight not stay confinedto what we call the target species.That's because of gene flow,which is a fancy way of sayingthat neighboring speciessometimes interbreed.If that happens, it's possiblea gene drive could cross over,like Asian carp could infectsome other kind of carp.That's not so bad if your drivejust promotes a trait, like eye color.In fact, there's a decentchance that we'll seea wave of very weird fruit fliesin the near future.But it could be a disasterif your drive is deignedto eliminate the species entirely. The last worrisome thingis that the technology to do this,to genetically engineer an organismand include a gene drive,is something that basically any labin the world can do.An undergraduate can do it.A talented high schoolerwith some equipment can do it. Now, I'm guessingthat this sounds terrifying. (Laughter) Interestingly though,nearly every scientist I talk toseemed to think that gene drives were notactually that frightening or dangerous.Partly because they believethat scientists will bevery cautious and responsibleabout using them. (Laughter) So far, that's been true.But gene drives also havesome actual limitations.So for one thing, they workonly in sexually reproducing species.So thank goodness, they can't be usedto engineer viruses or bacteria.Also, the trait spreadsonly with each successive generation.So changing or eliminating a populationis practical only if that specieshas a fast reproductive cycle,like insects or maybesmall vertebrates like mice or fish.In elephants or people,it would take centuriesfor a trait to spreadwidely enough to matter. Also, even with CRISPR, it's not that easyto engineer a truly devastating trait.Say you wanted to make a fruit flythat feeds on ordinary fruitinstead of rotting fruit,with the aim of sabotagingAmerican agriculture.First, you'd have to figure outwhich genes controlwhat the fly wants to eat,which is already a very longand complicated project.Then you'd have to alter those genesto change the fly's behaviorto whatever you'd want it to be,which is an even longerand more complicated project.And it might not even work,because the genesthat control behavior are complex.So if you're a terroristand have to choosebetween starting a gruelingbasic research programthat will require years of meticulouslab work and still might not pan out,or just blowing stuff up?You'll probably choose the later. This is especially truebecause at least in theory,it should be pretty easyto build what's called a reversal drive.That's one that basically overwritesthe change made by the first gene drive.So if you don't likethe effects of a change,you can just release a second drivethat will cancel it out,at least in theory. OK, so where does this leave us?We now have the abilityto change entire species at will.Should we?Are we gods now?I'm not sure I'd say that.But I would say this:first, some very smart peopleare even now debatinghow to regulate gene drives.At the same time,some other very smart peopleare working hard to create safeguards,like gene drives that self-regulateor peter out after a few generations.That's great.But this technology still requiresa conversation.And given the nature of gene drives,that conversation has to be global.What if Kenya wants to use a drivebut Tanzania doesn't?Who decides whether to releasea gene drive that can fly? I don't have the answer to that question.All we can do going forward, I think,is talk honestlyabout the risks and benefitsand take responsibility for our choices.By that I mean, not just the choiceto use a gene drive,but also the choice not to use one.Humans have a tendency to assumethat the safest optionis to preserve the status quo.But that's not always the case.Gene drives have risks,and those need to be discussed,but malaria exists nowand kills 1,000 people a day.To combat it, we spray pesticidesthat do grave damage to other species,including amphibians and birds. So when you hear about gene drivesin the coming months,and trust me, you willbe hearing about them,remember that.It can be frightening to act,but sometimes, not acting is worse. (Applause) CRISPR gene drives allow scientists to change sequences of DNA and guarantee that the resulting edited genetic trait is inherited by future generations, opening up the possibility of altering entire species forever. More than anything, the technology has led to questions: How will this new power affect humanity? What are we going to use it to change? Are we gods now?

93	"Today, I am going to show youhow this tablet and this virtual-realityheadset that I'm wearingare going to completelyrevolutionize science education.And I'm also going to show youhow it can make any science teachermore than twice as effective.But before I show youhow all of this is possible,let's talk briefly about why improvingthe quality of science educationis so vitally important. If you think about it,the world is growing incredibly fast.And with that growth comesa whole list of growing challenges,challenges such as dealingwith global warming,solving starvation and water shortagesand curing diseases,to name just a few. And who, exactly, is going to help ussolve all of these great challenges?Well, to a very last degree,it is these young students.This is the next generationof young, bright scientists.And in many ways, we all rely on themfor coming up with new, great innovationsto help us solve allthese challenges ahead of us.And so a couple of years back,my cofounder and I were teachinguniversity students just like these,only the students we were teachinglooked a little bit more like this here. (Laughter) And yes, this is reallythe reality out therein way too many universitiesaround the world:students that are bored, disengagedand sometimes not even surewhy they're learning about a topicin the first place. So we started looking around for new,innovative teaching methods,but what we found was quite disappointing.We saw that books were beingturned into e-books,blackboards were being turnedinto YouTube videosand lecture hall monologueswere being turned into MOOCs —massive online open courses.And if you think about it,all we're really doing hereis taking the same contentand the same format,and bringing it out to more students —which is great, don't get mewrong, that is really great —but the teaching methodis still more or less the same,no real innovation there. So we started looking elsewhere.What we found was that flight simulatorshad been proven over and over againto be far more effectivewhen used in combination with real,in-flight training to train the pilots.And so we thought to ourselves:Why not just apply that to science?Why not build a virtuallaboratory simulator? Well, we did it.We basically set out to createa fully simulated, one-to-one,virtual reality laboratory simulator,where the studentscould perform experimentswith mathematical equationsthat would simulate what wouldhappen in a real-world lab.But not just simple simulations —we would also create advanced simulationswith top universities like MIT,to bring out cutting-edge cancerresearch to these students.And suddenly, the universitiescould save millions of dollarsby letting the studentsperform virtual experimentsbefore they go into the real laboratory.And not only that; now,they could also understand —even on a molecular levelinside the machine —what is happening to the machines.And then they could suddenly performdangerous experiments in the labs as well.For instance also here,learning about salmonella bacteria,which is an important topicthat many schools cannot teachfor good safety reasons.And we, of course, quiz the studentsand then give the teachersa full dashboard,so they fully understandwhere the students are at. But we didn't stop there,because we had seen justhow important meaning isfor the students' engagement in the class.So we brought in game designersto create fun and engaging stories.For instance, here in this case,where the students have to solvea mysterious CSI murder caseusing their core science skills. And the feedback we gotwhen we launched all of thiswas quite overwhelmingly positive.Here we have 300 students,all passionately solving CSI murder caseswhile learning core science skills.And what I love the most about thisis really when the studentscome up to me sometimes afterwards,all surprised and a little confused,and say, \"I just spent two hoursin this virtual lab,and ... and I didn't check Facebook.\"n(Laughter) That's how engaging and immersivethis really is for the students. And so, to investigatewhether this really worked,a learning psychologistdid a study with 160 students —that was from Stanford Universityand Technical University of Denmark.And what they did is splitthe students into two groups.One group would only usethe virtual laboratory simulations,the other group would only usetraditional teaching methods,and they had the same amount of time.Then, interestingly,they gave the students a testbefore and after the experiment,so they could clearly measurethe learning impact of the students.And what they foundwas a surprisingly high 76 percentincrease in the learning effectivenesswhen using virtual laboratoriesover traditional teaching methods. But even more interestingly,the second part of this study investigatedwhat the teacher's impactwas on the learning.And what they foundwas that when you combinedthe virtual laboratorieswith teacher-led coaching and mentoring,then we saw a total 101 percentincrease in the learning effectiveness,which effectively doublesthe science teacher's impactwith the same amount of time spent.So a couple of months back,we started asking ourselves —we have a wonderful team nowof learning psychologistsand teachers and scientistsand game developers —and we started asking ourselves:How can we keep ourselves to our promiseof constantly reimagining education? And today, I am really excitedto be presenting what we came up withand have been workingincredibly hard to create.I will explain briefly what this is.Basically, I take my mobile phone —most students alreadyhave these, smartphones —and I plug it into this virtual-realityheadset, a low-cost headset.And now what I can effectively do is,I can literally stepinto this virtual world.We'll have some of youin the audience also get to try this,because it is really somethingthat you have to tryto fully feel how immersive it really is.It literally feels like I just steppedinside this virtual lab.Do you see me up on the screen? Audience: Yes. Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome. So basically, I have justturned my mobile phoneinto a fully simulated, million-dollarIvy League laboratorywith all this amazing equipmentthat I can interact with.I can, for instance, pick up the pipetteand do experiments with it.I have my E-Ggel, my PCRand — oh, look there,I have my next-generationsequencing machine,and there I even havemy electron microscope.I mean, who's carrying aroundan electron microscope in their pocket?And here I have my machine,I can do different experimentson the machine.And over here I have the door,I can go into other experiments,I can perform in the laboratories.And here, I have my learning tablet.This is an intelligent tabletthat allows me to readabout relevant theory.As you can see, I can interact with it.I can watch videos and seecontent that is relevantto the experimentthat I'm performing right now.Then over here, I have Marie.She is my teacher —my lab assistant —and what she does is guides methrough this whole laboratory.And very soon,the teachers will be ableto literally teleport themselvesinto this virtual worldthat I'm in right nowand help me, guide me,through this whole experiment. And now before I finalize this,I want to show youan even cooler thing, I think —something you cannoteven do in real laboratories.This is a PCR machine.I'm now going to start this experiment.And what I just did is literallyshrunk myself a million timesinto the size of a molecule —and it really feels like it,you have to try this.So now it feels likeI'm standing inside the machineand I'm seeing all the DNA,and I see the molecules.I see the polymeraseand the enzymes and so forth.And I can see how in this case,DNA is being replicated millions of times,just like it's happeninginside your body right now.And I can really feel and understandhow all of this works. Now, I hope that gives youa little bit of a senseof the possibilitiesin these new teaching methods.And I want to also emphasizethat everything you just sawalso works on iPads and laptopswithout the headsets.I say that for a very important reason.In order for us to reallyempower and inspirethe next generation of scientists,we really need teachersto drive the adoptionof new technologies in the classroom.And so in many ways,I believe that the next big,quantum leap in science educationlies no longer with the technology,but rather with the teachers' decisionto push forward and adoptthese technologiesinside the classrooms.And so it is our hope that moreuniversities and schools and teacherswill collaborate with technology companiesto realize this full potential. And so,lastly, I'd like to leave youwith a little storythat really inspires me.And that is the story of Jack Andraka.Some of you might already know him.Jack invented a new, groundbreakinglow-cost test for pancreatic cancerat the age 15.And when Jack shares his storyof how he did this huge breakthrough,he also explains that one thingalmost prevented himfrom making this breakthrough.And that was that he did nothave access to real laboratories,because he was too inexperiencedto be allowed in. Now, imagine if we could bringIvy League, million-dollarvirtual laboratoriesout to all these students just like Jack,all over the world,and give them the latest, greatest,most fancy machines you can imaginethat would quite literallymake any scientist in herejump up and down out of pure excitement.And then imagine how thatwould empower and inspirea whole new generationof young and bright scientists,ready to innovate and change the world. Thank you very much. (Applause) Virtual reality is no longer part of some distant future, and it's not just for gaming and entertainment anymore. Michael Bodekaer wants to use it to make quality education more accessible. In this refreshing talk, he demos an idea that could revolutionize the way we teach science in schools.

94	"Design is a slipperyand elusive phenomenon,which has meant differentthings at different times.But all truly inspiring design projectshave one thing in common:they began with a dream.And the bolder the dream,the greater the design featthat will be required to achieve it.And this is why the greatestdesigners are almost alwaysthe biggest dreamersand rebels and renegades. This has been the case throughout history,all the way back to the year 300 BC,when a 13-year-old became the kingof a remote, very poorand very small Asian country.He dreamt of acquiring land,riches and powerthrough military conquest.And his design skills —improbable though it sounds —would be essentialin enabling him to do so. At the time,all weapons were made by handto different specifications.So if an archer ran outof arrows during a battle,they wouldn't necessarily be ableto fire another archer's arrowsfrom their bow.This of course meant that they wouldbe less effective in combatand very vulnerable, too.Ying solved this problemby insisting that all bows and arrowswere designed identically,so they were interchangeable.And he did the same for daggers,axes, spears, shieldsand every other form of weaponry.His formidably equipped armywon batter after battle,and within 15 years,his tiny kingdom hadsucceeded in conqueringall its larger, richer,more powerful neighbors,to found the mighty Chinese Empire. Now, no one, of course,would have thought of describingYing Zheng as a designer at the time —why would they?And yet he used designunknowingly and instinctivelybut with tremendous ingenuityto achieve his ends.And so did another equallyimprobable, accidental designer,who was also not above usingviolence to get what he wanted.This was Edward Teach, better knownas the British pirate, Blackbeard. This was the golden age of piracy,where pirates like Teachwere terrorizing the high seas.Colonial trade was flourishing,and piracy was highly profitable.And the smarter pirates like himrealized that to maximize their spoils,they needed to attacktheir enemies so brutallythat they would surrender on sight.So in other words,they could take the shipswithout wasting ammunition,or incurring casualties. So Edward Teach redesignedhimself as Blackbeardby playing the part of a merciless brute.He wore heavy jackets and big hatsto accentuate his height.He grew the bushy black beardthat obscured his face.He slung braces of pistolson either shoulder.He even attached matches to the brimof his hat and set them alight,so they sizzled menacinglywhenever his ship was poised to attack.And like many pirates of that era,he flew a flag that borethe macabre symbolsof a human skulland a pair of crossed bones,because those motifs had signified deathin so many cultures for centuries,that their meaningwas instantly recognizable,even in the lawless, illiterateworld of the high seas:surrender or you'll suffer.So of course, all his sensiblevictims surrendered on sight. Put like that,it's easy to see why Edward Teachand his fellow piratescould be seen as pioneersof modern communications design,and why their deadly symbol —n(Laughter) there's more —why their deadly symbolof the skull and crossboneswas a precursor of today's logos,rather like the big red lettersstanding behind me,but of course with a different message. (Laughter) Yet design was also used to nobler endsby an equally brilliant and equallyimprobable designer,the 19th-century British nurse,Florence Nightingale.Her mission was to providedecent healthcare for everyone.Nightingale was born into a rathergrand, very wealthy British family,who were horrified when she volunteeredto work in military hospitalsduring the Crimean War.Once there, she swiftly realizedthat more patients were dyingof infections that they caught there,in the filthy, fetid wards,than they were of battle wounds.So she campaignedfor cleaner, lighter, airier clinicsto be designed and built. Back in Britain,she mounted another campaign,this time for civilian hospitals,and insisted that the same designprinciples were applied to them.The Nightingale ward, as it is called,dominated hospital designfor decades to come,and elements of it are still used today.But by then,design was seen as a toolof the Industrial Age.It was formalized and professionalized,but it was restricted to specific rolesand generally applied in pursuitof commercial goalsrather than being used intuitively,as Florence Nightingale, Blackbeardand Ying Zheng had done. By the 20th century,this commercial ethos was so powerful,that any designers who deviated from itrisked being seen as cranksor subversives. Now among them is oneof my great design heroes,the brilliant László Moholy-Nagy.He was the Hungarian artist and designerwhose experiments with the impactof technology on daily lifewere so powerfulthat they still influencethe design of the digital imageswe see on our phone and computer screens.He radicalized the Bauhaus DesignSchool in 1920s Germany,and yet some of his formercolleagues shunned himwhen he struggled to open a newBauhaus in Chicago years later.Moholy's ideas were as boldand incisive as ever,but his approach to designwas too experimental,as was his insistenceon seeing it, as he put it,as an attitude, not a professionto be in tune with the times. And sadly, the same appliedto another design maverick:Richard Buckminster Fuller.He was yet anotherbrilliant design visionaryand design activist,who was completely committedto designing a sustainable societyin such a forward-thinking waythat he started talking aboutthe importance of environmentalismin design in the 1920s.Now he, despite his efforts,was routinely mocked as a crankby many in the design establishment,and admittedly,some of his experiments failed,like the flying carthat never got off the ground.And yet, the geodesic dome,his design formula to buildan emergency shelterfrom scraps of wood, metal, plastic,bits of tree, old blankets,plastic sheeting —just about anythingthat's available at the time —is one of the greatest featsof humanitarian design,and has provided sorely needed refugeto many, many peoplein desperate circumstancesever since. Now, it was the courageand verve of radical designerslike Bucky and Moholythat drew me to design.I began my career as a news journalistand foreign correspondent.I wrote about politics, economicsand corporate affairs,and I could have chosento specialize in any of those fields.But I picked design,because I believe it's one of the mostpowerful tools at our disposalto improve our quality of life. Thank you, fellow TED design buffs. (Applause) And greatly as I admire the achievementsof professional designers,which have been extraordinary and immense,I also believethat design benefits hugelyfrom the originality,the lateral thinkingand the resourcefulnessof its rebels and renegades.And we're living at a remarkablemoment in design,because this is a time when the two campsare coming closer together.Because even very basic advancesin digital technologyhave enabled them to operateincreasingly independently,in or out of a commercial context,to pursue ever more ambitiousand eclectic objectives. So in theory,basic platforms like crowdfunding,cloud computing, social mediaare giving greater freedomto professional designersand giving more resourcesfor the improvisational ones,and hopefully,a more receptive response to their ideas. Now, some of my favoriteexamples of this are in Africa,where a new generation of designersare developing incredibleInternet of Things technologiesto fulfill Florence Nightingale's dreamof improving healthcarein countries where more peoplenow have access to cell phonesthan to clean, running water. And among them is Arthur Zang.He's a young, Cameroonian design engineerwho has a adapted a tabletcomputer into the Cardiopad,a mobile heart-monitoring device.It can be used to monitor the heartsof patients in remote, rural areas.The data is then senton a cellular networkto well-equipped hospitalshundreds of miles awayfor analysis.And if any problems are spottedby the specialists there,a suitable course of treatmentis recommended.And this of course saves many patientsfrom making long, arduous, expensiveand often pointless journeysto those hospitals,and makes it much, much likelierthat their heartswill actually be checked. Arthur Zang started workingon the Cardiopad eight years ago,in his final year at university.But he failed to persuadeany conventional sourcesto give him investment to getthe project off the ground.He posted the idea on Facebook,where a Camerooniangovernment official saw itand managed to securea government grant for him.He's now developingnot only the Cardiopad,but other mobile medical devicesto treat different conditions. And he isn't alone,because there are many otherinspiring and enterprising designerswho are also pursuingextraordinary projects of their own.And I'm going to finishby looking at just a few of them.One is Peek Vision.This is a group of doctorsand designers in Kenya,who've developed an Internet of Thingstechnology of their own,as a portable eye examination kit.Then there's Gabriel Maher,who is developing a new design languageto enable us to articulate the subtletiesof our changing gender identities,without recourseto traditional stereotypes. All of these designers and many moreare pursuing their dreams,by the making the mostof their newfound freedom,with the disciplineof professional designersand the resourcefulnessof rebels and renegades.And we all stand to benefit. Thank you. (Applause) In this ode to design renegades, Alice Rawsthorn highlights the work of unlikely heroes, from Blackbeard to Florence Nightingale. Drawing a line from these bold thinkers to some early modern visionaries like Buckminster Fuller, Rawsthorn shows how the greatest designers are often the most rebellious.

95	"How much do you needto know about a personbefore you'd feel comfortablemaking a loan? Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollarsto the person sitting two rows behind you.What would you need to knowabout that personbefore you'd feel comfortable? My mom came to the US from Indiain her late thirties.She's a doctor in Brooklyn,and she often lets friends and neighborscome to see her for health services,whether they can pay right away or not.I remember running into her patientswith her at the grocery storeor on the sidewalk,and sometimes they would comeand pay her right on the spotfor previous appointments.She would thank them,and ask them about their familiesand their health.She gave them creditbecause she trusted them. Most of us are like my mom.We would give credit to someone we knowor that we live next to.But most of us are probably notgoing to lend to a strangerunless we know a littlesomething about them. Banks, credit card companiesand other financial institutionsdon't know us on a personal level,but they do have a way of trusting us,and that's through our credit scores.Our credit scores have been createdthrough an aggregation and analysisof our public consumer credit data.And because of them, we havepretty much easy accessto all of the goodsand services that we need,from getting electricity to buying a home,or taking a risk and starting a business. But ...there are 2.5 billion peoplearound the worldthat don't have a credit score.That's a third of the world's population.They don't have a scorebecause there are no formalpublic records on them —no bank accounts,no credit historiesand no social security numbers.And because they don't have a score,they don't have accessto the credit or financial productsthat can improve their lives.They are not trusted. So we wanted to find a way to build trustand to open up financial accessfor these 2.5 billion.So we created a mobile applicationthat builds credit scores for themusing mobile data.There are currently over one billionsmartphones in emerging markets.And people are using themthe same way that we do.They're texting their friends,they're looking up directions,they're browsing the Internetand they're even makingfinancial transactions. Over time, this data is gettingcaptured on our phones,and it provides a really rich pictureof a person's life.Our customers give us access to this dataand we capture itthrough our mobile application.It helps us understandthe creditworthinessof people like Jenipher,a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya.Jenipher is 65 years old, and for decadeshas been running a food stallin the central business district.She has three sons who she putthrough vocational school,and she's also the leaderof her local chama,or savings group. Jenipher's food stall does well.She makes just enough every dayto cover her expenses.But she's not financially secure.Any emergency could force her into debt.And she has no discretionary incometo improve her family's way of living,for emergencies,or for investinginto growing her business.If Jenipher wants credit,her options are limited.She could get a microloan,but she'd have to form a groupthat could help vouch for her credibility.And even then, the loan sizeswould be way too smallto really have an impact on her business,averaging around 150 dollars.Loan sharks are always an option,but with interest ratesthat are well above 300 percent,they're financially risky.And because Jenipher doesn't havecollateral or a credit history,she can't walk into a bankand ask for a business loan. But one day,Jenipher's son convinced herto download our applicationand apply for a loan.Jenipher answered a fewquestions on her phoneand she gave us access to a fewkey data points on her device. And here's what we saw.So, bad news first.Jenipher had a low savings balanceand no previous loan history.These are factorsthat would have thrown upa red flag to a traditional bank.But there were other pointsin her history that showed usa much richer picture of her potential.So for one,we saw that she made regularphone calls to her family in Uganda.Well, it turns out that the data showsa four percent increase in repaymentamong people who consistentlycommunicate with a few close contacts.We could also seethat though she traveledaround a lot throughout the day,she actually had prettyregular travel patterns,and she was either at homeor at her food stall.And the data showsa six percent increase in repaymentamong customers who are consistentwith where they spend most of their time. We could also seethat she communicated a lotwith many different peoplethroughout the dayand that she had a strong support network.Our data showsthat people who communicatewith more than 58 different contactstend to be more likelyto be good borrowers.In Jenipher's case,she communicatedwith 89 different individuals,which showed a nine percentincrease in her repayment. These are just some of the thousandsof different data pointsthat we look at to understanda person's creditworthiness.And after analyzing allof these different data points,we took the first riskand gave Jenipher a loan.This is data that would notbe found on a paper trailor in any formal financial record.But it proves trust.By looking beyond income,we can see that people in emerging marketsthat may seem riskyand unpredictable on the surfaceare actually willing and havethe capacity to repay. Our credit scores have helped us deliverover 200,000 loans in Kenyain just the past year.And our repayment ratesare above 90 percent —which, by the way, is in linewith traditional bank repayment rates. With something as simpleas a credit score,we're giving people the powerto build their own futures.Our customers have usedtheir loans for family expenses,emergencies, traveland for investing backinto growing their businesses.They're now building bettereconomies and communitieswhere more people can succeed. Over the past two yearsof using our product,Jenipher has increasedher savings by 60 percent.She's also startedtwo additional food stallsand is now making plansfor her own restaurant.She's applying for a small-business loanfrom a commercial bank,because she now has the credit historyto prove she deserves it. I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week,and she told me how excitedshe was to get started.She said,\"Only my son believed I could do this.I didn't think this was for me.\"She's lived her whole lifebelieving that there was a partof the world that was closed off to her.

96	"I have one more reason for optimism:climate change.Maybe you don't believe it,but here is the fact. On December 12, 2015,in Paris, under the United Nations,195 governments got togetherand unanimously —if you've worked with governments,you know how difficult that is —unanimously decidedto intentionally change the courseof the global economyin order to protect the most vulnerableand improve the life of all of us.Now, that is a remarkable achievement. (Applause) But it is even more remarkableif you consider where we had beenjust a few years ago.2009, Copenhagen.Who remembers Copenhagen?Well, after years of workingtoward a climate agreement,the same governmentsconvened in Copenhagenand failed miserably. Why did it fail miserably?For many different reasons,but primarily becauseof the deeply entrenched dividebetween the globalNorth and the global South.So now, six months after this failure,I was called into assume the responsibilityof the global climate change negotiations.You can imagine, the perfect momentto start this new job.The global mood on climate changewas in the trash can.No one believedthat a global agreementcould ever be possible.In fact, neither did I.If you promise not to tell anyoneoutside of this wonderful TED audience,I'm going to divulge a secretthat has been gratefullyburied by history.On my first press conference,a journalist asked, \"Um, Ms. Figueres,do you think that a global agreementis ever going to be possible?\"And without engaging brain,I heard me utter,\"Not in my lifetime.\"Well, you can imaginethe faces of my press teamwho were horrifiedat this crazy Costa Rican womanwho was their new boss.And I was horrified, too.Now, I wasn't horrified at me,because I'm kind of used to myself.I was actually horrifiedat the consequencesof what I had just said,at the consequences for the worldin which all our childrenare going to have to live.It was frankly a horrible moment for me,and I thought, well, no, hang on,hang on.Impossible is not a fact,it's an attitude.It's only an attitude.And I decided right then and therethat I was going to change my attitudeand I was going to help the worldchange its attitude on climate change. So I don't know —No, just this? Thanks.I don't know —what you would doif you were toldyour job is to save the planet.Put that on the job description.And you have full responsibility,but you have absolutely no authority,because governments are sovereignin every decision that they take. Well, I would really love to knowwhat you would doon the first Monday morning,but here's what I did: I panicked. (Laughter) And then I panicked again,because I realized I have no ideahow we're going to solve this problem.And then I realized I have no ideahow we're going to solve this problem,but I do know one thing:we have got to changethe tone of this conversation.Because there is no wayyou can deliver victorywithout optimism. And here,I use optimism as a very simple word,but let's understand itin its broader sense.Let's understand it as courage,hope, trust, solidarity,the fundamental beliefthat we humans can come togetherand can help each otherto better the fate of mankind.Well, you can imaginethat I thought that without that,there was no way we were goingto get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.And for six years,I have stubbornly, relentlesslyinjected optimism into the system,no matter what the questionsfrom the press —and I have gotten better at those —and no matter what the evidenceto the contrary.And believe you me, there has beena lot of contrary evidence.But relentless optimism into the system. And pretty soon,we began to see changeshappening in many areas,precipitated by thousands of people,including many of you here today,and I thank you.And this TED communitywill not be surprisedif I tell you the first areain which we saw remarkable changewas ...technology.We began to see that clean technologies,in particular renewableenergy technologies,began to drop priceand increase in capacity,to the point where todaywe are already buildingconcentrated solar power plantsthat have the capacityto power entire cities,to say nothing of the factof what we are doing on mobilityand intelligent buildings.And with this shift in technologies,we were able to begin to understandthat there was a shiftin the economic equation,because we were able to recognizethat yes, there arehuge costs to climate change,and yes, there are compounded risks.But there also are economic advantagesand intrinsic benefits,because the disseminationof the clean technologiesis going to bring us cleaner air,better health,better transportation,more livable cities,more energy security,more energy accessto the developing world.In sum, a better worldthan what we have now. And with that understanding,you should have witnessed,in fact, part of you were,the spread of ingenuity and excitementthat went through,first through nonnational governments,the private sector, captains of industry,insurance companies,investors, city leaders,faith communities,because they all began to understand,this actually can be in their interest.This can actuallyimprove their bottom line. And it wasn't just the usual suspects.I have to tell you I had the CEOof a major, major oil and gas companycome to me at the beginning of last yearand say —privately, of course —he did not know howhe was going to change his company,but he is going to change it,because he's interestedin long-term viability.Well, now we have a shiftin the economic equation,and with that, with broadersupport from everyone,it did not take very longbefore we saw that national governmentswoke up to the factthat this is in their national interest.And when we asked countriesto begin to identifyhow they could contributeto global effortsbut based on their national interest,189 countries out of 195,189 countries sent theircomprehensive climate change plans,based on their national interest,concurrent with their priorities,consistent with their nationalsustainable development plans. Well,once you protectthe core interests of nations,then you can understandthat nations were readyto begin to converge onto a common path,onto a common direction of travelthat is going to take usprobably several decades,but over those several decadesis going to take usinto the new economy,into a decarbonized,highly resilient economy,And the national contributionsthat are currently on the tableon behalf of national governmentsare insufficient to get usto a stabilized climate,but they are only the first step,and they will improve over time.And the measurement, reportingand verification of all of those effortsis legally binding.And the checkpoints that we'regoing to have every five yearsto assess collective progresstowards our goal are legally binding,and the path itself towarda decarbonized and more resilient economyis legally binding. And here's the more important part:What did we have before?A very small handful of countrieswho had undertaken very reduced,short-term emission reduction commitmentsthat were completely insufficientand furthermore,largely perceived as a burden.Now what do we have?Now we have all countries of the worldcontributing with different intensitiesfrom different approachesin different sectors,but all of themcontributing to a common goaland along a pathwith environmental integrity.Well, once you have all of this in placeand you have shifted this understanding,then you see that governmentswere able to go to Parisand adopt the Paris agreement. (Applause) So,as I look backover the past six years,first I rememberthe day the Paris agreement was adopted.I cannot tell youthe euphoria in the room.5,000 people jumping out of their seats,crying, clapping, screaming, yelling,torn between euphoria and still disbeliefat what they had just seen,because so many peoplehad worked for years towards this,and this was finally their reality. And it wasn't just thosewho had participated directly.A few weeks ago, I was with a colleaguewho was trying to decideon a Tahitian pearl that he wantedto give to his wonderful wife Natasha.And once he had finally decidedwhat he was going to buy,the jeweler said to him,\"You know, you're very luckythat you're buying this now,because these pearls could go extinctvery soon because of climate change.\"\"But,\" the jeweler said, \"have you heard,the governmentshave just come to a decision,and Tahiti could have a chance.\"Well, what a fantastic confirmationthat perhaps, perhaps here is hope,here is a possible chance.I'm the first one to recognizethat we have a lot of work still to do.We've only just startedour work on climate change.And in fact, we need to make surethat we redouble our effortsover the next five yearsthat are the urgent five years.But I do believethat we have come over the past six yearsfrom the impossibleto the now unstoppable.And how did we do that?By injecting transformational optimismthat allowed us to gofrom confrontation to collaboration,that allowed us to understandthat national and local interestsare not necessarily at oddswith global needs,and that if we understand that,we can bring them togetherand we can merge them harmoniously. And as I look forwardto other global issuesthat will requireour attention this century —food security, water security,home security, forced migration —I see that we certainly do not knowhow we are going to solvethose problems yet.But we can take a pageout of what we have done on climate changeand we can understandthat we have got to reinterpretthe zero-sum mentality.Because we were trained to believethat there always are winners and losers,and that your loss is my gain.Well, now that we're in a worldin which we have reachedplanetary boundariesand that we are notjust so interconnected,but increasinglyinterdependent on each other,your loss is no longer my gain.We're either all losersor we all can be winners.But we are going to have to decidebetween zero and sum.We're going to have to decidebetween zero benefit for allor living life as the sum of all of us.We've done it once. We can do it again. Thanks. (Applause) What would you do if your job was to save the planet? When Christiana Figueres was tapped by the UN to lead the Paris climate conference (COP 21) in December 2015, she reacted the way many people would: she thought it would be impossible to bring the leaders of 195 countries into agreement on how to slow climate change. Find out how she turned her skepticism into optimism — and helped the world achieve the most important climate agreement in history. Christiana Figueres is the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), who led the recent COP 21 climate talks in Paris.

97	"I want you to reimaginehow life is organized on earth.Think of the planetlike a human body that we inhabit.The skeleton is the transportation systemof roads and railways,bridges and tunnels, air and seaportsthat enable our mobilityacross the continents.The vascular system that powers the bodyare the oil and gas pipelinesand electricity grids.that distribute energy.And the nervous system of communicationsis the Internet cables,satellites, cellular networksand data centers that allowus to share information. This ever-expanding infrastructural matrixalready consists of 64 millionkilometers of roads,four million kilometers of railways,two million kilometers of pipelinesand one million kilometersof Internet cables.What about international borders?We have less than500,000 kilometers of borders. Let's build a better map of the world.And we can start by overcomingsome ancient mythology.There's a saying with whichall students of history are familiar:\"Geography is destiny.\"Sounds so grave, doesn't it?It's such a fatalistic adage.It tells us that landlocked countriesare condemned to be poor,that small countriescannot escape their larger neighbors,that vast distances are insurmountable.But every journey I take around the world,I see an even greater forcesweeping the planet:connectivity. The global connectivity revolution,in all of its forms —transportation, energyand communications —has enabled such a quantum leapin the mobility of people,of goods, of resources, of knowledge,such that we can no longer even thinkof geography as distinct from it.In fact, I view the two forcesas fusing togetherinto what I call \"connectography.\"nConnectography represents a quantum leapin the mobility of people,resources and ideas,but it is an evolution,an evolution of the worldfrom political geography,which is how we legally divide the world,to functional geography,which is how we actually use the world,from nations and borders,to infrastructure and supply chains. Our global system is evolvingfrom the vertically integratedempires of the 19th century,through the horizontally interdependentnations of the 20th century,into a global network civilizationin the 21st century.Connectivity, not sovereignty,has become the organizing principleof the human species. (Applause) We are becomingthis global network civilizationbecause we are literally building it.All of the world's defense budgetsand military spending taken togethertotal just undertwo trillion dollars per year.Meanwhile, our globalinfrastructure spendingis projected to riseto nine trillion dollars per yearwithin the coming decade.And, well, it should.We have been livingoff an infrastructure stockmeant for a world populationof three billion,as our population has crossedseven billion to eight billionand eventually nine billion and more.As a rule of thumb, we should spendabout one trillion dollarson the basic infrastructure needsof every billion people in the world. Not surprisingly, Asia is in the lead.In 2015, China announced the creationof the Asian InfrastructureInvestment Bank,which together with a networkof other organizationsaims to construct a networkof iron and silk roads,stretching from Shanghai to Lisbon. And as all of this topographicalengineering unfolds,we will likely spend moreon infrastructure in the next 40 years,we will build more infrastructurein the next 40 years,than we have in the past 4,000 years. Now let's stop and thinkabout it for a minute.Spending so much more on buildingthe foundations of global societyrather than on the tools to destroy itcan have profound consequences.Connectivity is howwe optimize the distributionof people and resources around the world.It is how mankind comes to be morethan just the sum of its parts.I believe that is what is happening. Connectivity has a twin megatrendin the 21st century:planetary urbanization.Cities are the infrastructuresthat most define us.By 2030, more than two thirdsof the world's populationwill live in cities.And these are notmere little dots on the map,but they are vast archipelagosstretching hundreds of kilometers. Here we are in Vancouver,at the head of the Cascadia Corridorthat stretches southacross the US border to Seattle.The technology powerhouseof Silicon Valleybegins north of San Franciscodown to San Joseand across the bay to Oakland.The sprawl of Los Angelesnow passes San Diegoacross the Mexican border to Tijuana.San Diego and Tijuananow share an airport terminalwhere you can exit into either country.Eventually, a high-speed rail networkmay connect the entire Pacific spine.America's northeastern megalopolisbegins in Boston through New Yorkand Philadelphia to Washington.It contains more than 50 million peopleand also has plansfor a high-speed rail network. But Asia is where we really seethe megacities coming together.This continuous strip of lightfrom Tokyo through Nagoya to Osakacontains more than 80 million peopleand most of Japan's economy.It is the world's largest megacity.For now. But in China, megacity clustersare coming togetherwith populationsreaching 100 million people.The Bohai Rim around Beijing,The Yangtze River Delta around Shanghaiand the Pearl River Delta,stretching from Hong Kongnorth to Guangzhou.And in the middle,the Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster,whose geographic footprintis almost the same sizeas the country of Austria. And any number of these megacity clustershas a GDP approachingtwo trillion dollars —that's almost the sameas all of India today.So imagine if our global diplomaticinstitutions, such as the G20,were to base their membershipon economic sizerather than national representation.Some Chinese megacitiesmay be in and have a seat at the table,while entire countries,like Argentina or Indonesia would be out. Moving to India, whose populationwill soon exceed that of China,it too has a number of megacity clusters,such as the Delhi Capital Regionand Mumbai.In the Middle East,Greater Tehran is absorbingone third of Iran's population.Most of Egypt's 80 million peoplelive in the corridorbetween Cairo and Alexandria.And in the gulf, a necklaceof city-states is forming,from Bahrain and Qatar,through the United Arab Emiratesto Muscat in Oman. And then there's Lagos,Africa's largest cityand Nigeria's commercial hub.It has plans for a rail networkthat will make it the anchorof a vast Atlantic coastal corridor,stretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana,to Abidjan, the capitalof the Ivory Coast. But these countries are suburbs of Lagos.In a megacity world,countries can be suburbs of cities.By 2030, we will have as manyas 50 such megacity clusters in the world.So which map tells you more?Our traditional mapof 200 discrete nationsthat hang on most of our walls,or this map of the 50 megacity clusters? And yet, even this is incompletebecause you cannot understandany individual megacitywithout understandingits connections to the others.People move to cities to be connected,and connectivityis why these cities thrive.Any number of them,such as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow,has a GDP approaching or exceedingone third of one halfof their entire national GDP. But equally importantly,you cannot calculateany of their individual valuewithout understandingthe role of the flows of people,of finance, of technologythat enable them to thrive.Take the Gauteng province of South Africa,which contains Johannesburgand the capital Pretoria.It too represents just overa third of South Africa's GDP.But equally importantly,it is home to the officesof almost every singlemultinational corporationthat invests directly into South Africaand indeed, into the entireAfrican continent. Cities want to be partof global value chains.They want to be partof this global division of labor.That is how cities think.I've never met a mayor who said to me,\"I want my city to be cut off.\"They know that their cities belong as muchto the global network civilizationas to their home countries. Now, for many people,urbanization causes great dismay.They think cities are wrecking the planet.But right now,there are more than 200intercity learning networks thriving.That is as many as the numberof intergovernmental organizationsthat we have.And all of these intercity networksare devoted to one purpose,mankind's number one priorityin the 21st century:sustainable urbanization. Is it working?Let's take climate change.We know that summit after summitin New York and Parisis not going to reducegreenhouse gas emissions.But what we can seeis that transferring technologyand knowledge and policies between citiesis how we've actually begun to reducethe carbon intensity of our economies. Cities are learning from each other.How to install zero-emissions buildings,how to deploy electriccar-sharing systems.In major Chinese cities,they're imposing quotason the number of cars on the streets.In many Western cities,young people don't evenwant to drive anymore.Cities have been part of the problem,now they are part of the solution. Inequality is the other great challengeto achieving sustainable urbanization.When I travel through megacitiesfrom end to end —it takes hours and days —I experience the tragedyof extreme disparitywithin the same geography.And yet, our global stockof financial assetshas never been larger,approaching 300 trillion dollars.That's almost four timesthe actual GDP of the world. We have taken on such enormous debtssince the financial crisis,but have we invested themin inclusive growth?No, not yet.Only when we build sufficient,affordable public housing,when we invest in robusttransportation networksto allow people to connect to each otherboth physically and digitally,that's when our dividedcities and societieswill come to feel whole again. (Applause) And that is why infrastructurehas just been includedin the United NationsSustainable Development Goals,because it enables all the others.Our political and economic leadersare learning that connectivityis not charity,it's opportunity.And that's why our financial communityneeds to understandthat connectivity is the mostimportant asset class of the 21st century. Now, cities can make the worldmore sustainable,they can make the world more equitable,I also believe thatconnectivity between citiescan make the world more peaceful.If we look at regions of the worldwith dense relations across borders,we see more trade, more investmentand more stability.We all know the storyof Europe after World War II,where industrial integrationkicked off a processthat gave rise to today'speaceful European Union.And you can see that Russia, by the way,is the least connected of major powersin the international system.And that goes a long waytowards explaining the tensions today.Countries that haveless stake in the systemalso have less to lose in disturbing it.In North America, the linesthat matter most on the mapare not the US-Canada borderor the US-Mexico border,but the dense network of roadsand railways and pipelinesand electricity gridsand even water canalsthat are forming an integratedNorth American union.North America does not need more walls,it needs more connections. (Applause) But the real promise of connectivityis in the postcolonial world.All of those regions where bordershave historically been the most arbitraryand where generations of leadershave had hostile relationswith each other.But now a new group of leadershas come into powerand is burying the hatchet. Let's take Southeast Asia,where high-speed rail networksare planned to connectBangkok to Singaporeand trade corridorsfrom Vietnam to Myanmar.Now this region of 600 million peoplecoordinates its agricultural resourcesand its industrial output.It is evolvinginto what I call a Pax Asiana,a peace among Southeast Asian nations. A similar phenomenonis underway in East Africa,where a half dozen countriesare investing in railwaysand multimodal corridorsso that landlocked countriescan get their goods to market.Now these countriescoordinate their utilitiesand their investment policies.They, too, are evolvinginto a Pax Africana. One region we know couldespecially use this kind of thinkingis the Middle East.As Arab states tragically collapse,what is left behindbut the ancient cities,such as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad?In fact, the nearly400 million people of the Arab worldare almost entirely urbanized.As societies, as cities,they are either water rich or water poor,energy rich or energy poor.And the only wayto correct these mismatchesis not through more wars and more borders,but through more connectivityof pipelines and water canals.Sadly, this is not yetthe map of the Middle East.But it should be,a connected Pax Arabia,internally integratedand productively connectedto its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa. Now, it may not seem like connectivityis what we want right nowtowards the world's most turbulent region.But we know from historythat more connectivity is the only wayto bring about stability in the long run.Because we knowthat in region after region,connectivity is the new reality.Cities and countriesare learning to aggregateinto more peaceful and prosperous wholes. But the real test is going to be Asia.Can connectivity overcomethe patterns of rivalryamong the great powers of the Far East?After all, this is where World War IIIis supposed to break out.Since the end of the Cold War,a quarter century ago,at least six major warshave been predicted for this region.But none have broken out. Take China and Taiwan.In the 1990s, this was everyone'sleading World War III scenario.But since that time,the trade and investment volumesacross the straits have become so intensethat last November,leaders from both sidesheld a historic summitto discuss eventualpeaceful reunification.And even the electionof a nationalist party in Taiwanthat's pro-independence earlier this yeardoes not underminethis fundamental dynamic. China and Japan havean even longer history of rivalryand have been deployingtheir air forces and naviesto show their strength in island disputes.But in recent years,Japan has been makingits largest foreign investments in China.Japanese cars are sellingin record numbers there.And guess wherethe largest number of foreignersresiding in Japan today comes from?You guessed it: China. China and India have fought a major warand have three outstandingborder disputes,but today India is the secondlargest shareholderin the Asian InfrastructureInvestment Bank.They're building a trade corridorstretching from Northeast Indiathrough Myanmar and Bangladeshto Southern China.Their trade volume has grownfrom 20 billion dollars a decade agoto 80 billion dollars today. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistanhave fought three warsand continue to dispute Kashmir,but they're also negotiatinga most-favored-nation trade agreementand want to complete a pipelinestretching from Iranthrough Pakistan to India. And let's talk about Iran.Wasn't it just two years agothat war with Iran seemed inevitable?Then why is every single major powerrushing to do business there today? Ladies and gentlemen,I cannot guaranteethat World War III will not break out.But we can definitely seewhy it hasn't happened yet.Even though Asia is hometo the world's fastest growing militaries,these same countriesare also investing billions of dollarsin each other's infrastructureand supply chains.They are more interestedin each other's functional geographythan in their political geography.And that is why their leaders think twice,step back from the brink,and decide to focus on economic tiesover territorial tensions. So often it seemslike the world is falling apart,but building more connectivityis how we put Humpty Dumptyback together again,much better than before.And by wrapping the worldin such seamless physicaland digital connectivity,we evolve towards a worldin which people can riseabove their geographic constraints.We are the cells and vesselspulsing through these globalconnectivity networks. Everyday, hundreds of millionsof people go onlineand work with people they've never met.More than one billion peoplecross borders every year,and that's expected to riseto three billion in the coming decade. We don't just build connectivity,we embody it.We are the global network civilization,and this is our map.A map of the world in whichgeography is no longer destiny.Instead, the futurehas a new and more hopeful motto:connectivity is destiny. Thank you. (Applause) \"I want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth,\" says global strategist Parag Khanna. As our expanding cities grow ever more connected through transportation, energy and communications networks, we evolve from geography to what he calls \"connectography.\" This emerging global network civilization holds the promise of reducing pollution and inequality — and even overcoming geopolitical rivalries. In this talk, Khanna asks us to embrace a new maxim for the future: \"Connectivity is destiny.\"nGeopolitical futurist Parag Khanna foresees a world in which megacities, supply chains and connective technologies redraw the map away from states and borders.

99	"Seven years ago, a student came to meand asked me to invest in his company.He said, \"I'm working with three friends,and we're going to try to disruptan industry by selling stuff online.\"And I said, \"OK, you guys spentthe whole summer on this, right?\"\"No, we all took internshipsjust in case it doesn't work out.\"\"All right, but you're going togo in full time once you graduate.\"\"Not exactly. We've alllined up backup jobs.\"Six months go by,it's the day before the company launches,and there is stillnot a functioning website.\"You guys realize,the entire company is a website.That's literally all it is.\"So I obviously declined to invest. And they ended upnaming the company Warby Parker. (Laughter)They sell glasses online.They were recently recognizedas the world's most innovative companyand valued at over a billion dollars.And now? My wife handles our investments.Why was I so wrong? To find out, I've been studying peoplethat I come to call \"originals.\"Originals are nonconformists,people who not only have new ideasbut take action to champion them.They are peoplewho stand out and speak up.Originals drive creativityand change in the world.They're the people you want to bet on.And they look nothing like I expected.I want to show you todaythree things I've learnedabout recognizing originalsand becoming a little bit more like them. So the first reasonthat I passed on Warby Parkerwas they were really slowgetting off the ground.Now, you are all intimately familiarwith the mind of a procrastinator.Well, I have a confession for you.I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator.Yes, that's an actual term.You know that panic you feela few hours before a big deadlinewhen you haven't done anything yet.I just feel thata few months ahead of time. (Laughter) So this started early: when I was a kid,I took Nintendo games very seriously.I would wake up at 5am,start playing and not stopuntil I had mastered them.Eventually it got so out of handthat a local newspaper cameand did a story on the dark sideof Nintendo, starring me. (Laughter) (Applause) Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. (Laughter) But this served me well in college,because I finished my senior thesisfour months before the deadline.And I was proud of that,until a few years ago.I had a student named Jihae,who came to me and said,\"I have my most creative ideaswhen I'm procrastinating.\"And I was like, \"That's cute,where are the four papers you owe me?\"n(Laughter) No, she was oneof our most creative students,and as an organizational psychologist,this is the kind of idea that I test.So I challenged her to get some data.She goes into a bunch of companies.She has people fill out surveysabout how often they procrastinate.Then she gets their bosses to ratehow creative and innovative they are.And sure enough,the precrastinators like me,who rush in and do everything earlyare rated as less creativethan people who procrastinate moderately.So I want to know what happensto the chronic procrastinators.She was like, \"I don't know.They didn't fill out my survey.\"n(Laughter) No, here are our results.You actually do see that the peoplewho wait until the last minuteare so busy goofing offthat they don't have any new ideas.And on the flip side,the people who race inare in such a frenzy of anxiety that theydon't have original thoughts either.There's a sweet spotwhere originals seem to live.Why is this?Maybe original peoplejust have bad work habits.Maybe procrastinatingdoes not cause creativity. To find out, we designed some experiments.We asked peopleto generate new business ideas,and then we get independent readersto evaluate how creativeand useful they are.And some of them are askedto do the task right away.Others we randomly assignto procrastinateby dangling Minesweeper in front of themfor either five or 10 minutes.And sure enough,the moderate procrastinatorsare 16 percent more creativethan the other two groups.Now, Minesweeper is awesome,but it's not the driver of the effect,because if you play the game firstbefore you learn about the task,there's no creativity boost.It's only when you're told that you'regoing to be working on this problem,and then you start procrastinating,but the task is still activein the back of your mind,that you start to incubate.Procrastination gives you timeto consider divergent ideas,to think in nonlinear ways,to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishingthese experiments,I was starting to writea book about originals,and I thought, \"This is the perfect timeto teach myself to procrastinate,while writing a chapteron procrastination.\"So I metaprocrastinated,and like any self-respectingprecrastinator,I woke up early the next morningand I made a to-do listwith steps on how to procrastinate. (Laughter) And then I worked diligentlytoward my goal of not makingprogress toward my goal.I started writingthe procrastination chapter,and one day — I was halfway through —I literally put it away in mid-sentencefor months.It was agony.But when I came back to it,I had all sorts of new ideas.As Aaron Sorkin put it,\"You call it procrastinating.I call it thinking.\"And along the way I discoveredthat a lot of great originalsin history were procrastinators.Take Leonardo da Vinci.He toiled on and off for 16 yearson the Mona Lisa.He felt like a failure.He wrote as much in his journal.But some of the diversionshe took in opticstransformed the way that he modeled lightand made him into a much better painter.What about Martin Luther King, Jr.?The night beforethe biggest speech of his life,the March on Washington,he was up past 3am, rewriting it.He's sitting in the audiencewaiting for his turn to go onstage,and he is still scribbling notesand crossing out lines.When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in,he leaves his prepared remarksto utter four wordsthat changed the course of history:\"I have a dream.\"That was not in the script.By delaying the task of finalizingthe speech until the very last minute,he left himself opento the widest range of possible ideas.And because the text wasn't set in stone,he had freedom to improvise. Procrastinating is a vicewhen it comes to productivity,but it can be a virtue for creativity.What you see with a lot of great originalsis that they are quick to startbut they're slow to finish.And this is what I missedwith Warby Parker.When they were draggingtheir heels for six months,I looked at them and said,\"You know, a lot of other companiesare starting to sell glasses online.\"They missed the first-mover advantage.But what I didn't realize wasthey were spending all that timetrying to figure out how to get peopleto be comfortable ordering glasses online.And it turns out the first-moveradvantage is mostly a myth.Look at a classic studyof over 50 product categories,comparing the first moverswho created the marketwith the improvers who introducedsomething different and better.What you see is that the first movershad a failure rate of 47 percent,compared with only 8 percentfor the improvers.Look at Facebook,waiting to build a social networkuntil after Myspace and Friendster.Look at Google, waiting for yearsafter Altavista and Yahoo.It's much easier to improveon somebody else's ideathan it is to createsomething new from scratch.So the lesson I learned is thatto be original you don't have to be first.You just have to be different and better. But that wasn't the only reasonI passed on Warby Parker.They were also full of doubts.They had backup plans lined up,and that made me doubtthat they had the courage to be original,because I expected that originalswould look something like this. (Laughter) Now, on the surface,a lot of original people look confident,but behind the scenes,they feel the same fear and doubtthat the rest of us do.They just manage it differently.Let me show you: this is a depictionof how the creative processworks for most of us. (Laughter) Now, in my research, I discoveredthere are two different kinds of doubt.There's self-doubt and idea doubt.Self-doubt is paralyzing.It leads you to freeze.But idea doubt is energizing.It motivates you to test,to experiment, to refine,just like MLK did.And so the key to being originalis just a simple thingof avoiding the leapfrom step three to step four.Instead of saying, \"I'm crap,\"you say, \"The first few draftsare always crap,and I'm just not there yet.\"So how do you get there?Well, there's a clue, it turns out,in the Internet browser that you use.We can predict your job performanceand your commitmentjust by knowing what web browser you use.Now, some of you are notgoing to like the results of this study —n(Laughter) But there is good evidencethat Firefox and Chrome userssignificantly outperformInternet Explorer and Safari users.Yes. (Applause) They also stay in their jobs15 percent longer, by the way.Why? It's not a technical advantage.The four browser groupson average have similar typing speedand they also have similar levelsof computer knowledge.It's about how you got the browser.Because if you useInternet Explorer or Safari,those came preinstalled on your computer,and you accepted the default optionthat was handed to you.If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,you had to doubt the defaultand ask, is therea different option out there,and then be a little resourcefuland download a new browser.So people hear about this studyand they're like,\"Great, if I want to get better at my job,I just need to upgrade my browser?\"n(Laughter) No, it's about being the kind of personwho takes the initiativeto doubt the defaultand look for a better option.And if you do that well,you will open yourself upto the opposite of déjà vu.There's a name for it.It's called vuja de. (Laughter) Vuja de is when you look at somethingyou've seen many times beforeand all of a suddensee it with fresh eyes.It's a screenwriterwho looks at a movie scriptthat can't get the green lightfor more than half a century.In every past version,the main character has been an evil queen.But Jennifer Lee starts to questionwhether that makes sense.She rewrites the first act,reinvents the villain as a tortured heroand Frozen becomesthe most successful animated movie ever.So there's a simple messagefrom this story.When you feel doubt, don't let it go. (Laughter) What about fear?Originals feel fear, too.They're afraid of failing,but what sets them apartfrom the rest of usis that they're even moreafraid of failing to try.They know you can failby starting a business that goes bankruptor by failing to start a business at all.They know that in the long run,our biggest regrets are not our actionsbut our inactions.The things we wish we could redo,if you look at the science,are the chances not taken. Elon Musk told me recently,he didn't expect Tesla to succeed.He was sure the first few SpaceX launcheswould fail to make it to orbit,let alone get back,but it was too important not to try.And for so many of us,when we have an important idea,we don't bother to try.But I have some good news for you.You are not going to get judgedon your bad ideas.A lot of people think they will.If you look across industriesand ask people about their biggest idea,their most important suggestion,85 percent of them stayed silentinstead of speaking up.They were afraid of embarrassingthemselves, of looking stupid.But guess what? Originalshave lots and lots of bad ideas,tons of them, in fact.Take the guy who invented this.Do you care that he came upwith a talking doll so creepythat it scared not only kidsbut adults, too?No. You celebrate Thomas Edisonfor pioneering the light bulb. (Laughter) If you look across fields,the greatest originalsare the ones who fail the most,because they're the ones who try the most.Take classical composers,the best of the best.Why do some of them get more pagesin encyclopedias than othersand also have their compositionsrerecorded more times?One of the best predictorsis the sheer volumeof compositions that they generate.The more output you churn out,the more variety you getand the better your chancesof stumbling on something truly original.Even the three icons of classical music —Bach, Beethoven, Mozart —had to generate hundredsand hundreds of compositionsto come up with a much smallernumber of masterpieces.Now, you may be wondering,how did this guy become greatwithout doing a whole lot?I don't know how Wagner pulled that off.But for most of us,if we want to be more original,we have to generate more ideas. The Warby Parker founders, when theywere trying to name their company,they needed something sophisticated,unique, with no negative associationsto build a retail brand,and they tested over 2,000 possibilitiesbefore they finally put togetherWarby and Parker.So if you put all this together,what you see is that originalsare not that differentfrom the rest of us.They feel fear and doubt.They procrastinate.They have bad ideas.And sometimes, it's not in spiteof those qualities but because of themthat they succeed. So when you see those things,don't make the same mistake I did.Don't write them off.And when that's you,don't count yourself out either.Know that being quick to startbut slow to finishcan boost your creativity,that you can motivate yourselfby doubting your ideasand embracing the fear of failing to try,and that you need a lot of bad ideasin order to get a few good ones. Look, being original is not easy,but I have no doubt about this:it's the best wayto improve the world around us. Thank you. (Applause) How do creative people come up with great ideas? Organizational psychologist Adam Grant studies \"originals\": thinkers who dream up new ideas and take action to put them into the world. In this talk, learn three unexpected habits of originals — including embracing failure. \"The greatest originals are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most,\" Grant says. \"You need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones.\"nAfter years of studying the dynamics of success and productivity in the workplace, Adam Grant discovered a powerful and often overlooked motivator: helping others.

100	"Here are two reasons companies fail:they only do more of the same,or they only do what's new. To me the real, realsolution to quality growthis figuring out the balancebetween two activities:exploration and exploitation.Both are necessary,but it can be too much of a good thing. Consider Facit.I'm actually old enough to remember them.Facit was a fantastic company.They were born deep in the Swedish forest,and they made the bestmechanical calculators in the world.Everybody used them.And what did Facit do whenthe electronic calculator came along?They continued doing exactly the same.In six months, they wentfrom maximum revenue ...and they were gone.Gone. To me, the irony about the Facit storyis hearing about the Facit engineers,who had bought cheap, smallelectronic calculators in Japanthat they used to double-checktheir calculators. (Laughter) Facit did too much exploitation.But exploration can go wild, too. A few years back,I worked closely alongsidea European biotech company.Let's call them OncoSearch.The company was brilliant.They had applications that promisedto diagnose, even cure,certain forms of blood cancer.Every day was aboutcreating something new.They were extremely innovative,and the mantra was,\"When we only get it right,\"or even, \"We want it perfect.\"The sad thing is,before they became perfect —even good enough —they became obsolete.OncoSearch did too much exploration. I first heard about explorationand exploitation about 15 years ago,when I worked as a visitingscholar at Stanford University.The founder of the idea is Jim March.And to me the power of the ideais its practicality. Exploration.Exploration is aboutcoming up with what's new.It's about search,it's about discovery,it's about new products,it's about new innovations.It's about changing our frontiers.Our heroes are peoplewho have done exploration:Madame Curie,Picasso,Neil Armstrong,Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.I come from Norway;all our heroes are explorers,and they deserve to be.We all know that exploration is risky.We don't know the answers,we don't know if we're going to find them,and we know that the risks are high. Exploitation is the opposite.Exploitation is takingthe knowledge we haveand making good, better.Exploitation is about makingour trains run on time.It's about making good productsfaster and cheaper.Exploitation is not risky —in the short term.But if we only exploit,it's very risky in the long term.And I think we all have memoriesof the famous pop groupswho keep singing the same songsagain and again,until they become obsoleteor even pathetic.That's the risk of exploitation. So if we take a long-termperspective, we explore.If we take a short-termperspective, we exploit.Small children, they explore all day.All day it's about exploration.As we grow older,we explore less because we havemore knowledge to exploit on.The same goes for companies.Companies become,by nature, less innovativeas they become more competent. And this is, of course,a big worry to CEOs.And I hear very often questionsphrased in different ways.For example,\"How can I both effectively runand reinvent my company?\"Or, \"How can I make surethat our company changesbefore we become obsoleteor are hit by a crisis?\"So, doing one well is difficult.Doing both well as the same time is art —pushing both exploration and exploitation. So one thing we've foundis only about two percent of companiesare able to effectively exploreand exploit at the same time, in parallel.But when they do,the payoffs are huge.So we have lots of great examples.We have Nestlé creating Nespresso,we have Lego going into animated films,Toyota creating the hybrids,Unilever pushing into sustainability —there are lots of examples,and the benefits are huge. Why is balancing so difficult?I think it's difficultbecause there are so many trapsthat keep us where we are.So I'll talk about two,but there are many. So let's talk aboutthe perpetual search trap.We discover something,but we don't have the patienceor the persistenceto get at it and make it work.So instead of staying with it,we create something new.But the same goes for that,then we're in the vicious circleof actually coming up with ideasbut being frustrated.OncoSearch was a good example.A famous example is, of course, Xerox.But we don't only see this in companies.We see this in the public sector as well.We all know that any kindof effective reform of education,research, health care, even defense,takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.But still, we change much more often.We really don't give them the chance. Another trap is the success trap.Facit fell into the success trap.They literally heldthe future in their hands,but they couldn't see it.They were simply so goodat making what they loved doing,that they wouldn't change.We are like that, too.When we know something well,it's difficult to change.Bill Gates has said:\"Success is a lousy teacher.It seduces us into thinkingwe cannot fail.\"That's the challenge with success. So I think there are some lessons,and I think they apply to us.And they apply to our companies.The first lesson is:get ahead of the crisis.And any company that's able to innovateis actually able to also buyan insurance in the future.Netflix — they could so easilyhave been contentwith earlier generations of distribution,but they always — and I thinkthey will always —keep pushing for the next battle.I see other companies that say,\"I'll win the next innovation cycle,whatever it takes.\"nSecond one: think in multiple time scales.I'll share a chart with you,and I think it's a wonderful one.Any company we look at,taking a one-year perspectiveand looking at the valuationof the company,innovation typically accountsfor only about 30 percent.So when we think one year,innovation isn't really that important.Move ahead, take a 10-year perspectiveon the same company —suddenly, innovation and abilityto renew account for 70 percent.But companies can't choose.They need to fund the journeyand lead the long term. Third:invite talent.I don't think it's possible for any of usto be able to balance explorationand exploitation by ourselves.I think it's a team sport.I think we need to allow challenging.I think the mark of a great companyis being open to be challenged,and the mark of a good corporate boardis to constructively challenge.I think that's also whatgood parenting is about. Last one: be skeptical of success.Maybe it's useful to think backat the old triumph marches in Rome,when the generals, after a big victory,were given their celebration.Riding into Rome on the carriage,they always had a companionwhispering in their ear,\"Remember, you're only human.\"nSo I hope I made the point:balancing exploration and exploitationhas a huge payoff.But it's difficult,and we need to be conscious. I want to just point out two questionsthat I think are useful.First question is,looking at your own company:In which areas do you seethat the company is at the riskof falling into success traps,of just going on autopilot?And what can you do to challenge? Second question is:When did I explore something new last,and what kind of effect did it have on me?Is that something I should do more of?In my case, yes. So let me leave you with this.Whether you're an explorer by natureor whether you tend to exploitwhat you already know,don't forget: the beautyis in the balance. Thank you. (Applause) Is it possible to run a company and reinvent it at the same time? For business strategist Knut Haanaes, the ability to innovate after becoming successful is the mark of a great organization. He shares insights on how to strike a balance between perfecting what we already know and exploring totally new ideas — and lays out how to avoid two major strategy traps. IMD's Knut Haanaes believes that the secret to creating lasting, impactful companies is to find a balance between doing what you're good at and looking for new challenges to take on.

101	"So there are landsfew and far between on Earth itselfthat are hospitable to humansby any measure,but survive we have.Our primitive ancestors, when they foundtheir homes and livelihood endangered,they dared to make their wayinto unfamiliar territoriesin search of better opportunities.And as the descendants of these explorers,we have their nomadic bloodcoursing through our own veins.But at the same time,distracted by our bread and circusesand embroiled in the warsthat we have waged on each other,it seems that we have forgottenthis desire to explore.We, as a species, we're evolved uniquelyfor Earth, on Earth, and by Earth,and so content are wewith our living conditionsthat we have grown complacentand just too busyto notice that its resources are finite,and that our Sun's life is also finite.While Mars and all the moviesmade in its namehave reinvigoratedthe ethos for space travel,few of us seem to truly realizethat our species' fragile constitutionis woefully unpreparedfor long duration journeys into space. Let us take a trekto your local national forestfor a quick reality check.So just a quick show of hands here:how many of you think you would be ableto survive in this lush wildernessfor a few days?Well, that's a lot of you.How about a few weeks?That's a decent amount.How about a few months?That's pretty good too.Now, let us imaginethat this local national forestexperiences an eternal winter.Same questions: how many of you think youwould be able to survive for a few days?That's quite a lot.How about a few weeks?So for a fun twist, let us imaginethat the only source of water availableis trapped as frozen blocksmiles below the surface.Soil nutrients are so minimalthat no vegetation can be found,and of course hardly any atmosphereexists to speak of. Such examples are only a fewof the many challenges we would faceon a planet like Mars.So how do we steel ourselves for voyageswhose destinations are so far removedfrom a tropical vacation?Will we continuously ship suppliesfrom Planet Earth?Build space elevators,or impossible miles of transport beltsthat tether your planet of choiceto our home planet?And how do we grow things like foodthat grew up on Earth like us? But I'm getting ahead of myself.In our species' journeyto find a new home under a new sun,we are more likely than notgoing to be spending much timein the journey itself,in space,on a ship, a hermetic flying can,possibly for many generations. The longest continuous amount of timethat any human has spent in spaceis in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.From astronauts' experiences in space,we know that spending timein a microgravity environmentmeans bone loss, muscle atrophy,cardiovascular problems,among many other complicationsthat range for the physiologicalto the psychological.And what about macrogravity,or any other variationin gravitational pullof the planet that we find ourselves on? In short, our cosmic voyageswill be fraught with dangersboth known and unknown.So far we've been looking to thisnew piece of mechanical technologyor that great next generation robotas part of a lineup to ensureour species safe passage in space.Wonderful as they are,I believe the time has comefor us to complementthese bulky electronic giantswith what nature has already invented:the microbe,a single-celled organism that is itselfa self-generating, self-replenishing,living machine.It requires fairly little to maintain,offers much flexibility in designand only asks to be carriedin a single plastic tube. The field of study that has enabled usto utilize the capabilities of the microbeis known as synthetic biology.It comes from molecular biology,which has given us antibiotics, vaccinesand better ways to observethe physiological nuancesof the human body.Using the tools of synthetic biology,we can now edit the genesof nearly any organism,microscopic or not,with incredible speed and fidelity.Given the limitationsof our man-made machines,synthetic biology will be a means for usto engineer not only our food,our fuel and our environment,but also ourselvesto compensatefor our physical inadequaciesand to ensure our survival in space. To give you an exampleof how we can use synthetic biologyfor space exploration,let us return to the Mars environment.The Martian soil composition is similarto that of Hawaiian volcanic ash,with trace amounts of organic material.Let's say, hypothetically,what if martian soilcould actually support plant growthwithout using Earth-derived nutrients?The first questionwe should probably ask is,how would we makeour plants cold-tolerant?Because, on average,the temperature on Marsis a very uninvitingnegative 60 degrees centigrade.The next question we should ask is,how do we makeour plants drought-tolerant?Considering that most of the waterthat forms as frostevaporates more quicklythan I can say the word \"evaporate.\"Well, it turns outwe've already done things like this.By borrowing genesfor anti-freeze protein from fishand genes for drought tolerancefrom other plants like riceand then stitching theminto the plants that need them,we now have plants that can toleratemost droughts and freezes.They're known on Earth as GMOs,or genetically modified organisms,and we rely on them to feedall the mouths of human civilization.Nature does stuff like this already,without our help.We have simply foundmore precise ways to do it. So why would we want to changethe genetic makeup of plants for space?Well, to not do sowould mean needing to engineerendless acres of landon an entirely new planetby releasing trillions of gallonsof atmospheric gassesand then constructinga giant glass dome to contain it all.It's an unrealistic engineering enterprisethat quickly becomesa high-cost cargo transport mission.One of the best ways to ensurethat we will have the food suppliesand the air that we needis to bring with us organismsthat have been engineeredto adapt to new and harsh environments.In essence, using engineered organismsto help us terraform a planetboth in the short and long term.These organisms can then alsobe engineered to make medicine or fuel. So we can use synthetic biologyto bring highly engineered plants with us,but what else can we do?Well, I mentioned earlierthat we, as a species,were evolved uniquely for planet Earth.That fact has not changed muchin the last five minutesthat you were sitting hereand I was standing there.And so, if we were to dumpany of us on Mars right this minute,even given ample food, water, airand a suit,we are likely to experiencevery unpleasant health problemsfrom the amount of ionizing radiationthat bombards the surfaceof planets like Mars that have littleor nonexistent atmosphere.Unless we planto stay holed up undergroundfor the duration of our stayon every new planet,we must find better waysof protecting ourselveswithout needing to resortto wearing a suit of armorthat weighs somethingequal to your own body weight,or needing to hide behind a wall of lead. So let us appealto nature for inspiration.Among the plethora of life here on Earth,there's a subset of organismsknown as extremophiles,or lovers of extreme living conditions,if you'll rememberfrom high school biology.And among these organisms is a bacteriumby the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.It is known to be able to withstand cold,dehydration, vacuum, acid,and, most notably, radiation.While its radiationtolerance mechanisms are known,we have yet to adaptthe relevant genes to mammals.To do so is not particularly easy.There are many facetsthat go into its radiation tolerance,and it's not as simpleas transferring one gene.But given a little bit of human ingenuityand a little bit of time,I think to do so is not very hard either.Even if we borrow just a fractionof its ability to tolerate radiation,it would be infinitely betterthan what we already have,which is just the melanin in our skin.Using the tools of synthetic biology,we can harness Deinococcusradiodurans' abilityto thrive under otherwisevery lethal doses of radiation.As difficult as it is to see,homo sapiens, that is humans,evolves every day,and still continues to evolve.Thousands of years of human evolutionhas not only given ushumans like Tibetans,who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions,but also Argentinians,who can ingest and metabolize arsenic,the chemical elementthat can kill the average human being.Every day, the human body evolvesby accidental mutationsthat equally accidentallyallow certain humansto persevere in dismal situations. But, and this is a big but,such evolution requires two thingsthat we may not always have,or be able to afford,and they are death and time.In our species' struggleto find our place in the universe,we may not always have the time necessaryfor the natural evolutionof extra functionsfor survival on non-Earth planets.We're living in what E.O. Wilsonhas termed the age of gene circumvention,during which we remedy our genetic defectslike cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophywith temporary external supplements.But with every passing day,we approach the ageof volitional evolution,a time during which we as a specieswill have the capacity to decidefor ourselves our own genetic destiny.Augmenting the human bodywith new abilitiesis no longer a question of how,but of when. Using synthetic biologyto change the genetic makeupof any living organisms,especially our own,is not without its moraland ethical quandaries.Will engineering ourselvesmake us less human?But then again, what is humanitybut star stuffthat happens to be conscious?Where should human genius direct itself?Surely it is a bit of a wasteto sit back and marvel at it.How do we use our knowledgeto protect ourselvesfrom the external dangersand then protect ourselves from ourselves? I pose these questionsnot to engender the fear of sciencebut to bring to lightthe many possibilitiesthat science has affordedand continues to afford us.We must coalesce as humansto discuss and embrace the solutionsnot only with cautionbut also with courage. Mars is a destination,but it will not be our last.Our true final frontieris the line we must crossin deciding what we can and should makeof our species' improbable intelligence. Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving.Our path to the starswill be rife with trialsthat will bring us to questionnot only who we arebut where we will be going.The answers will lie in our choiceto use or abandon the technologythat we have gleaned from life itself,and it will define us for the remainderof our term in this universe. Thank you. (Applause) If we hope to one day leave Earth and explore the universe, our bodies are going to have to get a lot better at surviving the harsh conditions of space. Using synthetic biology, Lisa Nip hopes to harness special powers from microbes on Earth — such as the ability to withstand radiation — to make humans more fit for exploring space. \"We're approaching a time during which we'll have the capacity to decide our own genetic destiny,\" Nip says. \"Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how, but of when.\"nLisa Nip's work focuses on how we can use synthetic biology to allow humanity to explore spacenLisa Nip's work focuses on how we can use synthetic biology to allow humanity to explore space"
103	"Today's computers are so amazingthat we fail to noticehow terrible they really are.I'd like to talk to you todayabout this problem,and how we can fix it with neuroscience. First, I'd like to take you backto a frosty night in Harlem in 2011that had a profound impact on me.I was sitting in a dive baroutside of Columbia University,where I studied computer scienceand neuroscience,and I was having this great conversationwith a fellow studentabout the power of hologramsto one day replace computers.And just as we were gettingto the best part of the conversation,of course, his phone lights up.And he pulls it towards himself,and he looks down and he starts typing.And then he forces his eyeballsback up to mine and he goes,\"Keep going. I'm with you.\"But of course his eyes were glazed over,and the moment was dead. Meanwhile across the bar,I noticed another studentholding his phone,this time towards a group.He was swiping throughpictures on Instagram,and these kids were laughing hysterically.And that dichotomybetween how crappy I was feelingand how happy they were feelingabout the same technology,really got me thinking.And the more I thought of it,the more I realizedit was clearly not the digital informationthat was the bad guy here,it was simply the display positionthat was separating me from my friendand that was binding those kids together. See, they were connected around something,just like our ancestorswho evolved their social cognitionstelling stories around the campfire.And that's exactly what toolsshould do, I think.They should extend our bodies.And I think computers todayare doing quite the opposite.Whether you're sendingan email to your wifeor you're composing a symphonyor just consoling a friend,you're doing it in prettymuch the same way.You're hunched over these rectangles,fumbling with buttons and menusand more rectangles.And I think this is the wrong way,I think we can start usinga much more natural machine.We should use machines that bringour work back into the world.We should use machines that usethe principles of neuroscienceto extend our sensesversus going against them. Now it just so happensthat I have such a machine here.It's called the Meta 2.Let's try it out.Now in front of me right now,I can see the audience,and I can see my very hands.And in three, two, one,we're going to see an immersivehologram appear,a very realistic hologramappear in front of me,of our very glasses I'm wearingon my head right now.And of course this could beanything that we're shopping foror learning from,and I can use my handsto very nicely kind of moveit around with fine control.And I think Iron Man would be proud.We're going to come backto this in just a bit. (Applause) Now if you're anything like me,your mind is already reelingwith the possibilities of what we can dowith this kind of technology,so let's look at a few. My mom is an architect,so naturally the first thing I imaginedwas laying out a building in 3D spaceinstead of having to usethese 2D floor plans.She's actually touching graphics right nowand selecting an interior decor.This was all shot through a GoProthrough our very glasses. And this next use caseis very personal to me,it's Professor Adam Gazzaley'sglass brain project,courtesy of UCSF.As a neuroscience student,I would always fantasizeabout the ability to learn and memorizethese complex brain structureswith an actual machine,where I could touch and playwith the various brain structures. Now what you're seeingis called augmented reality,but to me, it's partof a much more important story —a story of how we can beginto extend our bodies with digital devices,instead of the other way around. Now ...in the next few years, humanity'sgoing to go through a shift, I think.We're going to start puttingan entire layer of digital informationon the real world.Just imagine for a momentwhat this could mean for storytellers,for painters,for brain surgeons,for interior decoratorsand maybe for all of us here today.And what I think we needto do as a community,is really try and make an effortto imagine how we cancreate this new realityin a way that extendsthe human experience,instead of gamifying our realityor cluttering it with digital information.And that's what I'm very passionate about. Now, I want to tell you a little secret.In about five years —this is not the smallest device —in about five years,these are all going to look likestrips of glass on our eyesthat project holograms.And just like we don't care so muchabout which phone we buyin terms of the hardware — we buy itfor the operating system —as a neuroscientist,I always dreamt of buildingthe iOS of the mind, if you will.And it's very, very importantthat we get this right,because we might be livinginside of these thingsfor at least as long as we've livedwith the Windows graphical user interface.And I don't know about you,but living inside of Windows scares me. (Laughter) To isolate the single most intuitiveinterface out of infinity,we use neuroscience to driveour design guidelines,instead of letting a bunch of designersfight it out in the boardroom.And the principle we all revolve aroundis what's called the \"Neural Pathof Least Resistance.\"nAt every turn, we're connectingthe iOS of the brain with our brainon, for the first time, our brain's terms.In other words, we're trying to createa zero learning-curve computer.We're building a systemthat you've always known how to use. Here are the first threedesign guidelines that we employin this brand-new form of user experience.First and foremost,you are the operating system.Traditional file systemsare complex and abstract,and they take your brainextra steps to decode them.We're going against the Neural Pathof Least Resistance.Meanwhile, in augmented reality,you can of course placeyour holographic TED panel over here,and your holographic emailon the other side of the desk,and your spatial memory evolved just fineto go ahead and retrieve them.You could put your holographic Teslathat you're shopping for —or whatever model my legal teamtold me to put in right before the show. (Laughter) Perfect. And your brain knowsexactly how to get it back. The second interface guidelinewe call \"touch to see.\"What do babies do when they seesomething that grabs their interest?They try and reach out and touch it.And that's exactly how the naturalmachine should work as well.Turns out the visual systemgets a fundamental boostfrom a sense we call proprioception —that's the senseof our body parts in space.So by touching our work directly,we're not only going to control it better,we're also going to understandit much more deeply.Hence, touch to see. But it's not enoughto experience things ourselves.We're inherently these social primates.And this leads me to our third guideline,the holographic campfirefrom our first story. Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggeststhat we can connect with each otherand with our work much betterif we can see each other'sfaces and hands in 3D.So if you look at the video behind me,you can see two Meta usersplaying around with the same hologram,making eye contact,connected around this thing,instead of being distractedby external devices. Let's go ahead and try this againwith neuroscience in mind.So again, our favorite interface,the iOS of the mind.I'm going to now take a step furtherand go ahead and grab this pair of glassesand leave it right here by the desk.I'm now with you, I'm in the moment,we're connecting.My spatial memory kicks in,and I can go ahead and grab itand bring it right back here, reminding methat I am the operating system.And now my proprioception is working,and I can go ahead and explodethese glasses into a thousand partsand touch the very sensorthat is currently scanning my hand. But it's not enough to see things alone,so in a second, my co-founder Rayis going to make a 3D call —Ray? (Ringing) Hey Ray, how's it going?Guys, I can see this guyin front me in full 3D.And he is photo-realistic. (Applause) Thank you. My mirror-neuron subsystem suggeststhat this is going to replace phonesin not too long.Ray, how's it going? Ray: Great. We're live today. (Applause) MG: Ray, give the crowd a giftof the holographic brainwe saw from the video earlier.Guys, this is not onlygoing to change phones,it's also going to changethe way we collaborate. Thank you so much. Thanks, Ray. Ray: You're welcome. (Applause) MG: So folks, this is the messagethat I discovered in that bar in 2011:The future of computers is notlocked inside one of these screens.It's right here, inside of us. (Applause) So if there's one idea that I couldleave you with here today,it's that the natural machineis not some figment of the future,it's right here in 2016.Which is why all hundred of us at Meta,including the administrative staff,the executives,the designers, the engineers —before TED2017,we're all going to be throwingaway our external monitorsand replacing them with a trulyand profoundly more natural machine. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you, appreciate it.Thanks, guys. Chris Anderson: So helpme out on one thing,because there've been a fewaugmented reality demosshown over the last year or so out there.And there's sometimesa debate among technologistsabout, are we really seeingthe real thing on-screen?There's this issue of field of view,that somehow the technologyis showing a broader viewthan you would actually seewearing the glasses.Were we seeing the real deal there? MG: Absolutely the real deal.Not only that,we took extra measures to shoot itwith a GoPro through the actual lensin the various videosthat you've seen here.We want to try to simulatethe experience for the worldthat we're actually seeingthrough the glasses,and not cut any corners. CA: Thank you so much for showing us that. MG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that. What if technology could connect us more deeply with our surroundings instead of distracting us from the real world? With the Meta 2, an augmented reality headset that makes it possible for users to see, grab and move holograms just like physical objects, Meron Gribetz hopes to extend our senses through a more natural machine. Join Gribetz as he takes the TED stage to demonstrate the reality-shifting Meta 2 for the first time. (Featuring Q&A with TED Curator Chris Anderson) At Meta, Meron Gribetz is leading an effort to produce and sell augmented reality glasses with natural gestural hand recognition.

104	"Hannah is excited to be going to college.She couldn't waitto get out of her parents' house,to prove to them that she's an adult,and to prove to her new friendsthat she belongs. She heads to a campus partywhere she sees a guythat she has a crush on.Let's call him Mike.The next day, Hannah wakes upwith a pounding headache.She can only rememberthe night in flashes.But what she does remember isthrowing up in the halloutside Mike's roomand staring at the wall silentlywhile he was inside her,wanting it to stop,then shakily stumbling home.She doesn't feel good about what happened,but she thinks, \"Maybe this is justwhat sex in college is?\"nOne in five women and one in 13 menwill be sexually assaultedat some point during their college careerin the United States.Less than 10 percent will ever reporttheir assault to their schoolor to the police.And those who do, on average,wait 11 months to make the report. Hannah initially just feels like dealingwith what happened on her own.But when she sees Miketaking girls home from parties,she's worried about them. After graduation, Hannah learnsthat she was one of five womenwho Mike did the exact same thing to.And this is not an unlikely scenariobecause 90 percent of sexual assaultsare committed by repeat offenders.But with such low reporting rates,it's fairly unlikely that evenrepeat perpetrators will be reported,much less anything happen if they are. In fact, only six percentof assaults reported to the policeend with the assailantspending a single day in prison.Meaning, there's a 99 percent chancethat they'll get away with it.This means there's practicallyno deterrent to assaultin the United States. Now, I'm an infectious diseaseepidemiologist by training.I'm interested in systems and networksand where we can concentrateour resources to do the most good.So this, to me, is a tragicbut a solvable problem. So when the issue of campus assaultstarted hitting the news a few years ago,it felt like a unique opportunityto make a change.And so we did.We started by talkingto college survivors.And what they wish they'd hadin college is pretty simple;they wanted a website,one they could useat the time and placethat felt safest to themwith clearly written informationabout their reporting options,with the ability to electronicallyreport their assault,rather than having the first stepto go in and talk to someonewho may or may not believe them.With the option to createa secure, timestamped documentof what happened to them,preserving evidenceeven if they don't want to report yet.And lastly, and perhaps most critically,with the ability to report their assaultonly if someone elsereported the same assailant.You see, knowing that you weren'tthe only one changes everything.It changes the wayyou frame your own experience,it changes the wayyou think about your perpetrator,it means that if you do come forward,you'll have someone else's backand they'll have yours. We created a websitethat actually does thisand we launched it [...] in August,on two college campuses. And we included a unique matching systemwhere if Mike's first victimhad come forward,saved her record,entered into the matching systemand named Mike,and Mike's second victimhad done the same thinga few months later,they would have matchedand the verified contact informationof both survivorswould have been sentto the authorities at the same timefor investigation and follow up. If a system like this had existedfor Hannah and her peers,it's more likelythat they would have reported,that they would have been believed,and that Mike would have beenkicked off campus,gone to jail, or at leastgotten the help that he needed.And if we were able to stoprepeat offenders like Mikeafter just their second assaultfollowing a match,survivors like Hannahwould never even be assaultedin the first place.We could prevent59 percent of sexual assaultsjust by stoppingrepeat perpetrators earlier on.And because we're creatinga real deterrent to assault,for perhaps the first time,maybe the Mikes of the worldwould never even try to assault anyone. The type of system I'm describing,the type of system that survivors wantis a type of information escrow,meaning an entity that holds onto information for youand only releases it to a third partywhen certain pre-agreed uponconditions are met,such as a match.The application that we builtis for college campuses.But the same type of systemcould be used in the militaryor even the workplace. We don't have to live in a worldwhere 99 percent of rapistsget away with it.We can create onewhere those who do wrongare held accountable,where survivors get the supportand justice they deserve,where the authoritiesget the information they need,and where there's a real deterrentto violating the rightsof another human being. Thank you. (Applause) We don't have to live in a world where 99 percent of rapists get away with it, says TED Fellow Jessica Ladd. With Callisto, a new platform for college students to confidentially report sexual assault, Ladd is helping survivors get the support and justice they deserve while respecting their privacy concerns. \"We can create a world where there's a real deterrent to violating the rights of another human being,\" she says.

105	"I want to tell you the storyabout the time I almost got kidnappedin the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.It's the day after graduatingfrom design schooland I'm having a yard sale.And this guy pulls up in this red Mazdaand he starts looking through my stuff.And he buys a piece of art that I made.And it turns out he's alonein town for the night,driving cross-country on a road tripbefore he goes into the Peace Corps.So I invite him out for a beerand he tells me all about his passionfor making a difference in the world. Now it's starting to get late,and I'm getting pretty tired.As I motion for the tab,I make the mistake of asking him,\"So where are you staying tonight?\"And he makes it worse by saying,\"Actually, I don't have a place.\"And I'm thinking, \"Oh, man!\"What do you do?We've all been there, right?Do I offer to host this guy?But, I just met him — I mean,he says he's going to the Peace Corps,but I don't really know if he's goingto the Peace Corpsand I don't want to end up kidnappedin the trunk of a Miata.That's a small trunk!nSo then I hear myself saying,\"Hey, I have an airbed you can stay onin my living room.\"And the voice in my head goes,\"Wait, what?\"nThat night, I'm laying in bed,I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,\"Oh my god, what have I done?There's a complete strangersleeping in my living room.What if he's psychotic?\"My anxiety grows so much,I leap out of bed,I sneak on my tiptoes to the door,and I lock the bedroom door. It turns out he was not psychotic.We've kept in touch ever since.And the piece of arthe bought at the yard saleis hanging in his classroom;he's a teacher now. This was my first hosting experience,and it completely changed my perspective.Maybe the people that my childhoodtaught me to label as strangerswere actually friends waitingto be discovered.The idea of hosting people on airbedsgradually became natural to meand when I moved to San Francisco,I brought the airbed with me. So now it's two years later.I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,my roommate moves out,and then the rent goes up.And then I learn there's a designconference coming to town,and all the hotels are sold out.And I've always believedthat turning fear into funis the gift of creativity. So here's what I pitch my best friendand my new roommate Brian Chesky:\"Brian, thought of a wayto make a few bucks —turning our place into 'designersbed and breakfast,'offering young designers who cometo town a place to crash,complete with wireless Internet,a small desk space,sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.Ha!\"nWe built a basic websiteand Airbed and Breakfast was born.Three lucky guests got to stayon a 20-dollar airbedon the hardwood floor.But they loved it, and so did we.I swear, the hamand Swiss cheese omelets we madetasted totally differentbecause we made them for our guests.We took them on adventuresaround the city,and when we said goodbyeto the last guest,the door latch clicked,Brian and I just stared at each other.Did we just discoverit was possible to make friendswhile also making rent? The wheels had started to turn.My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,joined as engineering co-founder.And we buckled down to seeif we could turn this into a business. Here's what we pitched investors:\"We want to build a websitewhere people publicly post picturesof their most intimate spaces,their bedrooms, the bathrooms —the kinds of rooms you usually keep closedwhen people come over.And then, over the Internet,they're going to invite complete strangersto come sleep in their homes.It's going to be huge!\"n(Laughter) We sat back, and we waitedfor the rocket ship to blast off.It did not.No one in their right mindswould invest in a servicethat allows strangersto sleep in people's homes.Why?Because we've all been taughtas kids, strangers equal danger. Now, when you're faced with a problem,you fall back on what you know,and all we really knew was design.In art school, you learnthat design is much morethan the look and feel of something —it's the whole experience.We learned to do that for objects,but here, we were aimingto build Olympic trustbetween people who had never met.Could design make that happen?Is it possible to design for trust? I want to give you a senseof the flavor of trustthat we were aiming to achieve.I've got a 30-second experimentthat will push you past your comfort zone.If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.OK, I need you to take out your phones.Now that you have your phone out,I'd like you to unlock your phone.Now hand your unlocked phoneto the person on your left. (Laughter) That tiny sense of panicyou're feeling right now —n(Laughter) is exactly how hosts feel the first timethey open their home.Because the only thingmore personal than your phoneis your home.People don't just see your messages,they see your bedroom,your kitchen, your toilet. Now, how does it feel holdingsomeone's unlocked phone?Most of us feel really responsible.That's how most guests feelwhen they stay in a home.And it's because of thisthat our company can even exist.By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone? (Laughter) Would you tell Twitterhe's running for President? (Laughter) (Applause) OK, you can hand your phones back now. So now that you've experiencedthe kind of trust challengewe were facing,I'd love to share a few discoverieswe've made along the way.What if we changed one small thingabout the design of that experiment?What if your neighbor had introducedthemselves first, with their name,where they're from, the nameof their kids or their dog?Imagine that they had 150 reviewsof people saying,\"They're great at holdingunlocked phones!\"n(Laughter) Now how would you feelabout handing your phone over? It turns out,a well-designed reputation systemis key for building trust.And we didn't actuallyget it right the first time.It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.Eventually, we learned to waituntil both guests and hostsleft the review before we reveal them. Now, here's a discoverywe made just last week.We did a joint study with Stanford,where we looked at people'swillingness to trust someonebased on how similar they are in age,location and geography.The research showed, not surprisingly,we prefer people who are like us.The more different somebody is,the less we trust them.Now, that's a natural social bias.But what's interesting is what happenswhen you add reputation into the mix,in this case, with reviews. Now, if you've gotless than three reviews,nothing changes.But if you've got more than 10,everything changes.High reputation beats high similarity.The right design can actuallyhelp us overcomeone of our most deeply rooted biases. Now we also learned that buildingthe right amount of trusttakes the right amount of disclosure.This is what happens when a guestfirst messages a host.If you share too little, like, \"Yo,\"acceptance rates go down.And if you share too much, like,\"I'm having issues with my mother,\"n(Laughter) acceptance rates also go down.But there's a zone that's just right,like, \"Love the artwork in your place.Coming for vacation with my family.\"So how do we design for justthe right amount of disclosure?We use the size of the boxto suggest the right length,and we guide them with promptsto encourage sharing. We bet our whole companyon the hope that,with the right design,people would be willing to overcomethe stranger-danger bias.What we didn't realizeis just how many peoplewere ready and waitingto put the bias aside. This is a graph that showsour rate of adoption.There's three things happening here.The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.The second is the efforts of our team.And third is the existenceof a previously unsatisfied need.Now, things have been going pretty well. Obviously, there are timeswhen things don't work out.Guests have thrown unauthorized partiesand trashed homes.Hosts have left guestsstranded in the rain.In the early days, I was customer service,and those calls cameright to my cell phone.I was at the front linesof trust breaking.And there's nothing worsethan those calls,it hurts to even think about them.And the disappointmentin the sound of someone's voicewas and, I would say, still isour single greatest motivatorto keep improving. Thankfully, out of the 123 million nightswe've ever hosted,less than a fraction of a percenthave been problematic.Turns out, peopleare justified in their trust.And when trust works out right,it can be absolutely magical. We had a guest staywith a host in Uruguay,and he suffered a heart attack.The host rushed him to the hospital.They donated their own bloodfor his operation.Let me read you his review. (Laughter) \"Excellent house for sedentary travelersprone to myocardial infarctions. (Laughter) The area is beautiful and hasdirect access to the best hospitals. (Laughter) Javier and Alejandra instantlybecome guardian angelswho will save your lifewithout even knowing you.They will rush you to the hospitalin their own car while you're dyingand stay in the waiting roomwhile the doctors give you a bypass.They don't want you to feel lonely,they bring you books to read.And they let you stay at their houseextra nights without charging you.Highly recommended!\"n(Applause) Of course, not every stay is like that.But this connection beyond the transactionis exactly what the sharingeconomy is aiming for. Now, when I heard that term,I have to admit, it tripped me up.How do sharingand transactions go together?So let's be clear; it is about commerce.But if you just called itthe rental economy,it would be incomplete.The sharing economy is commercewith the promise of human connection.People share a part of themselves,and that changes everything. You know how most travel today is, like,I think of it like fast food —it's efficient and consistent,at the cost of local and authentic.What if travel were likea magnificent buffetof local experiences?What if anywhere you visited,there was a central marketplace of localsoffering to get you thoroughly drunkon a pub crawl in neighborhoodsyou didn't even know existed.Or learning to cook from the chefof a five-star restaurant? Today, homes are designed aroundthe idea of privacy and separation.What if homes were designedto be shared from the ground up?What would that look like?What if cities embraceda culture of sharing?I see a future of shared citiesthat bring us community and connectioninstead of isolation and separation. In South Korea, in the city of Seoul,they've actually even started this.They've repurposed hundredsof government parking spotsto be shared by residents.They're connecting studentswho need a place to livewith empty-nesters who have extra rooms.And they've started an incubatorto help fund the next generationof sharing economy start-ups. Tonight, just on our service,785,000 peoplein 191 countrieswill either stay in a stranger's homeor welcome one into theirs.Clearly, it's not as crazyas we were taught. We didn't invent anything new.Hospitality has been around forever.There's been many otherwebsites like ours.So, why did ours eventually take off?Luck and timing aside,I've learned that you can takethe components of trust,and you can design for that.Design can overcome our most deeply rootedstranger-danger bias.And that's amazing to me.It blows my mind.I think about this every timeI see a red Miata go by. Now, we know design won't solveall the world's problems.But if it can help out with this one,if it can make a dent in this,it makes me wonder,what else can we design for next? Thank you. (Applause) Joe Gebbia, the co-founder of Airbnb, bet his whole company on the belief that people can trust each other enough to stay in one another's homes. How did he overcome the stranger-danger bias? Through good design. Now, 123 million hosted nights (and counting) later, Gebbia sets out his dream for a culture of sharing in which design helps foster community and connection instead of isolation and separation.

106	"In case you are wondering,no, I'm not wearing a dress,and no, I'm not sayingwhat I'm wearing underneath. (Laughter) This is a gho.This is my national dress.This is how all men dress in Bhutan.That is how our women dress.Like our women,we men get to wear pretty bright colors,but unlike our women,we get to show off our legs. (Laughter) Our national dress is unique,but this is not the only thingthat's unique about my country.Our promise to remaincarbon neutral is also unique,and this is what I'd liketo speak about today,our promise to remain carbon neutral. But before I proceed,I should set you the context.I should tell you our story. Bhutan is a small countryin the Himalayas.We've been called Shangri-La,even the last Shangri-La.But let me tell you right off the bat,we are not Shangri-La.My country is not one big monasterypopulated with happy monks. (Laughter) The reality is thatthere are barely 700,000 of ussandwiched between twoof the most populated countries on earth,China and India.The reality is that we are a small,underdeveloped countrydoing our best to survive.But we are doing OK. We are surviving.In fact, we are thriving,and the reason we are thrivingis because we've been blessedwith extraordinary kings.Our enlightened monarchshave worked tirelesslyto develop our country,balancing economic growth carefullywith social development,environmental sustainabilityand cultural preservation,all within the frameworkof good governance.We call this holistic approachto development\"Gross National Happiness,\" or GNH.Back in the 1970s,our fourth king famouslypronounced that for Bhutan,Gross National Happiness is more importantthan Gross National Product. (Applause) Ever since,all development in Bhutanis driven by GNH,a pioneering visionthat aims to improve the happinessand well-being of our people. But that's easier said than done,especially when you are oneof the smallest economies in the world.Our entire GDP is lessthan two billion dollars.I know that some of you hereare worth more —n(Laughter) individuallythan the entire economy of my country. So our economy is small,but here is where it gets interesting.Education is completely free.All citizens are guaranteedfree school education,and those that work hardare given free college education.Healthcare is also completely free.Medical consultation,medical treatment, medicines:they are all provided by the state.We manage thisbecause we use our limitedresources very carefully,and because we stay faithfulto the core mission of GNH,which is development with values.Our economy is small,and we must strengthen it.Economic growth is important,but that economic growth must not comefrom undermining our unique cultureor our pristine environment. Today, our culture is flourishing.We continue to celebrateour art and architecture,food and festivals,monks and monasteries.And yes, we celebrateour national dress, too.This is why I can wear my gho with pride.Here's a fun fact:you're lookingat the world's biggest pocket. (Laughter) It starts here,goes around the back,and comes out from inside here.In this pocketwe store all manner of personal goodsfrom phones and walletsto iPads, office files and books. (Laughter) (Applause) But sometimes —sometimes even precious cargo. So our culture is flourishing,but so is our environment.72 percent of my countryis under forest cover.Our constitution demandsthat a minimum of 60 percentof Bhutan's total landshall remain under forest coverfor all time. (Applause) Our constitution,this constitution,imposes forest cover on us.Incidentally, our kingused this constitutionto impose democracy on us.You see, we the peopledidn't want democracy.We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,and we certainly didn't fight for it.Instead, our king imposed democracy on usby insisting that he include itin the constitution.But he went further.He included provisions in the constitutionthat empower the peopleto impeach their kings,and included provisions in herethat require all our kings to retireat the age of 65. (Applause) Fact is, we already havea king in retirement:our previous king, the Great Fourth,retired 10 years agoat the peak of his popularity.He was all of 51 years at that time. So as I was saying,72 percent of our countryis under forest cover,and all that forest is pristine.That's why we are one of the few remainingglobal biodiversity hotspots in the world,and that's why we area carbon neutral country.In a world that is threatenedwith climate change,we are a carbon neutral country. Turns out, it's a big deal.Of the 200-odd countriesin the world today,it looks like we are the only onethat's carbon neutral.Actually, that's not quite accurate.Bhutan is not carbon neutral.Bhutan is carbon negative.Our entire country generates2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,but our forests, they sequestermore than three times that amount,so we are a net carbon sinkfor more than four million tonsof carbon dioxide each year.But that's not all. (Applause) We export mostof the renewable electricitywe generate from our fast-flowing rivers.So today, the clean energy that we exportoffsets about six million tonsof carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.By 2020, we'll be exportingenough electricityto offset 17 million tonsof carbon dioxide.And if we were to harnesseven half our hydropower potential,and that's exactly what we are working at,the clean, green energy that we exportwould offset something like50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.That is more CO2 than what the entire cityof New York generates in one year. So inside our country,we are a net carbon sink.Outside, we are offsetting carbon.And this is important stuff.You see, the world is getting warmer,and climate change is a reality.Climate change is affecting my country.Our glaciers are melting,causing flash floods and landslides,which in turn are causing disasterand widespread destruction in our country.I was at that lake recently.It's stunning.That's how it looked 10 years ago,and that's how it looked 20 years ago.Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.It was a solid glacier.A few years ago, a similar lakebreached its damsand wreaked havoc in the valleys below.That destructionwas caused by one glacier lake.We have 2,700 of them to contend with.The point is this:my country and my people have done nothingto contribute to global warming,but we are already bearing the bruntof its consequences.And for a small, poor country,one that is landlocked and mountainous,it is very difficult.But we are not going to siton our hands doing nothing.We will fight climate change.That's why we have promisedto remain carbon neutral. We first made this promise in 2009during COP 15 in Copenhagen,but nobody noticed.Governments were so busyarguing with one anotherand blaming each otherfor causing climate change,that when a small countryraised our hands and announced,\"We promise to remaincarbon neutral for all time,\"nobody heard us.Nobody cared. Last December in Paris,at COP 21, we reiterated our promiseto remain carbon neutralfor all time to come.This time, we were heard.We were noticed, and everybody cared.What was different in Pariswas that governments came round togetherto accept the realities of climate change,and were willing to come togetherand act together and work together.All countries, from the very smallto the very large,committed to reducethe greenhouse gas emissions.The UN Framework Conventionon Climate Changesays that if these so-calledintended commitments are kept,we'd be closerto containing global warmingby two degrees Celsius. By the way,I've requested the TED organizers hereto turn up the heat in hereby two degrees,so if some of youare feeling warmer than usual,you know who to blame. It's crucial that all of uskeep our commitments.As far as Bhutan is concerned,we will keep our promiseto remain carbon neutral.Here are some of the ways we are doing it.We are providing free electricityto our rural farmers.The idea is that, with free electricity,they will no longer have to use firewoodto cook their food.We are investing in sustainable transportand subsidizing the purchaseof electric vehicles.Similarly, we are subsidizingthe cost of LED lights,and our entire governmentis trying to go paperless.We are cleaning up our entire countrythrough Clean Bhutan, a national program,and we are planting treesthroughout our countrythrough Green Bhutan,another national program. But it is our protected areasthat are at the coreof our carbon neutral strategy.Our protected areas are our carbon sink.They are our lungs.Today, more than halfour country is protected,as national parks, nature reservesand wildlife sanctuaries.But the beauty is that we've connectedthem all with one anotherthrough a network of biological corridors.Now, what this meansis that our animals are freeto roam throughout our country.Take this tiger, for example.It was spottedat 250 meters above sea levelin the hot, subtropical jungles.Two years later, that same tigerwas spotted near 4,000 metersin our cold alpine mountains.Isn't that awesome? (Applause) We must keep it that way.We must keep our parks awesome.So every year, we set aside resourcesto prevent poaching, hunting,mining and pollution in our parks,and resources to help communitieswho live in those parksmanage their forests,adapt to climate change,and lead better lives while continuingto live in harmony with Mother Nature. But that is expensive.Over the next few years,our small economy won't have the resourcesto cover all the costs that are requiredto protect our environment.In fact, when we run the numbers,it looks like it'll take usat least 15 yearsbefore we can fully financeall our conservation efforts.But neither Bhutan,nor the worldcan afford to spend 15 yearsgoing backwards. This is why His Majesty the Kingstarted Bhutan For Life.Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need.It gives us breathing room.It is essentially a funding mechanismto look after our parks,to protect our parks,until our governmentcan take over on our own fully.The idea is to raise a transition fundfrom individual donors,corporations and institutions,but the deal is closed onlyafter predetermined conditions are metand all funds committed.So multiparty, single closing:an idea we borrowed from Wall Street.This means that individual donorscan commit without having to worrythat they'll be leftsupporting an underfunded plan.It's something like a Kickstarter project,only with a 15-year time horizonand millions of tonsof carbon dioxide at stake.Once the deal is closed,we use the transition fundto protect our parks,giving our government timeto increase our own funding graduallyuntil the end of the 15-year period.After that, our governmentguarantees full funding forever. We are almost there.We expect to close later this year.Naturally, I'm pretty excited. (Applause) The World Wildlife Fundis our principle partner in this journey,and I want to give them a big shoutoutfor the excellent workthey are doing in Bhutanand across the world. (Applause) Whew, it is getting warm in here. I thank you for listening to our story,a story of how we are keepingour promise to remain carbon neutral,a story of how we are keepingour country pristine,for ourselves, our children,for your children and for the world.But we are not hereto tell stories, are we?We are here to dream together.So in closing, I'd like to shareone more dream that I have.What if we could mobilizeour leadership and our resources,our influence and our passion,to replicate the Bhutan For Life ideato other countriesso that they toocan conserve theirprotected areas for all time.After all, there are many other countrieswho face the same issues that we face.They too have natural resourcesthat can help win the world's fightfor sustainability,only they may not have the abilityto invest in them now.So what if we set up Earth For Life,a global fund, to kickstartthe Bhutan For Life throughout the world?I invite you to help me,to carry this dream beyond our bordersto all those who careabout our planet's future.After all, we're here to dream together,to work together,to fight climate change together,to protect our planet together.Because the reality iswe are in it together.Some of us might dress differently,but we are in it together. Thank you very much,and kadrin chhe la. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you, thank you, thank you. Deep in the Himalayas, on the border between China and India, lies the Kingdom of Bhutan, which has pledged to remain carbon neutral for all time. In this illuminating talk, Bhutan's Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay shares his country's mission to put happiness before economic growth and set a world standard for environmental preservation. Acting on his mandate to move Bhutan into the 21st century, Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay is transforming his nation — while maintaining its “Gross National Happiness.”nActing on his mandate to move Bhutan into the 21st century, Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay is transforming his nation — while maintaining its “Gross National Happiness.”"
107	"In India, we have these huge families.I bet a lot of you allmust have heard about it.Which means that there area lot of family events.So as a child, my parentsused to drag me to these family events. But the one thingthat I always looked forward towas playing around with my cousins.And there was always this one unclewho used to be there,always ready, jumping around with us,having games for us,making us kids have the time of our lives.This man was extremely successful:he was confident and powerful.But then I saw this hale and hearty persondeteriorate in health.He was diagnosed with Parkinson's. Parkinson's is a disease that causesdegeneration of the nervous system,which means that this personwho used to be independentsuddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee,because of tremors, much more difficult.My uncle started using a walker to walk,and to take a turn,he literally had to takeone step at a time, like this,and it took forever.So this person, who used to bethe center of attentionin every family gathering,was suddenly hiding behind people.He was hiding from the pitiful lookin people's eyes. And he's not the only one in the world.Every year, 60,000 peopleare newly diagnosed with Parkinson's,and this number is only rising.As designers, we dream that our designssolve these multifaceted problems,one solution that solves it all,but it need not always be like that.You can also target simple problemsand create small solutions for themand eventually make a big impact.So my aim here wasto not cure Parkinson's,but to make their everyday tasksmuch more simple,and then make an impact. Well, the first thing I targetedwas tremors, right?My uncle told me that he had stoppeddrinking coffee or tea in publicjust out of embarrassment,so, well, I designed the no-spill cup.It works just purely on its form.The curve on top deflects the liquidback inside every time they have tremors,and this keeps the liquid insidecompared to a normal cup.But the key here is that it is not taggedas a Parkinson's patient product.It looks like a cup that could be usedby you, me, any clumsy person,and that makes it much more comfortingfor them to use, to blend in.So, well, one problem solved,many more to go. All this while, I was interviewing him,questioning him,and then I realized that I was gettingvery superficial information,or just answers to my questions.But I really needed to dig deeperto get a new perspective.So I thought, well,let's observe him in his daily tasks,while he's eating, while he's watching TV.And then, when I was actuallyobserving him walking to his dining table,it struck me, this man who finds itso difficult to walk on flat land,how does he climb a staircase?Because in India we do not havea fancy rail that takes you up a staircaselike in the developed countries.One actually has to climb the stairs.So he told me,\"Well, let me show you how I do it.\"Let's take a look at what I saw. So he took really longto reach this position,and then all this while, I'm thinking,\"Oh my God, is he really going to do it?Is he really, really going to do itwithout his walker?\"And then ... (Laughter) And the turns, he took them so easily. So — shocked?Well, I was too.So this person who could notwalk on flat landwas suddenly a pro at climbing stairs. On researching this, I realized thatit's because it's a continuous motion.There's this other manwho also suffers from the same symptomsand uses a walker,but the moment he's put on a cycle,all his symptoms vanish,because it is a continuous motion.So the key for me was to translatethis feeling of walking on a staircaseback to flat land.And a lot of ideaswere tested and tried on him,but the one that finally workedwas this one. Let's take a look. (Laughter) (Applause) He walked faster, right? (Applause) I call this the staircase illusion,and actually when the staircase illusionabruptly ended, he froze,and this is called freezing of gait.So it happens a lot,so why not have a staircase illusionflowing through all their rooms,making them feel much more confident?You know, technology is not always it.What we need are human-centered solutions.I could have easilymade it into a projection,or a Google Glass, or something like that.But I stuck to simple print on the floor.This print could be taken into hospitalsto make them feel much more welcome. What I wish to dois make every Parkinson's patientfeel like my uncle felt that day.He told me that I made him feellike his old self again. \"Smart\" in today's worldhas become synonymous to high tech,and the world is only gettingsmarter and smarter day by day.But why can't smart be somethingthat's simple and yet effective?All we need is a little bit of empathyand some curiosity,to go out there, observe.But let's not stop at that.Let's find these complex problems.Don't be scared of them.Break them, boil them downinto much smaller problems,and then find simple solutions for them.Test these solutions, fail if needed,but with newer insights to make it better.Imagine what we all could doif we all came up with simple solutions.What would the world be likeif we combined all our simple solutions?Let's make a smarter world,but with simplicity. Thank you. (Applause) Simple solutions are often best, even when dealing with something as complicated as Parkinson's. In this inspiring talk, Mileha Soneji shares accessible designs that make the everyday tasks of those living with Parkinson's a bit easier. \"Technology is not always it,\" she says. \"What we need are human-centered solutions.\"nMileha Soneji believes that having empathy and being able to put yourself in another person's shoes is what makes for great design.

108	"Food crisis.It's in the news every day.But what is it? Some places in the worldit's too little food,maybe too much.Other places, GMO is saving the world.Maybe GMO is the problem?Too much agricultural runoffcreating bad oceans, toxic oceans,attenuation of nutrition.They go on and on.And I find the current climateof this discussionincredibly disempowering.So how do we bring thatto something that we understand? How is this apple food crisis?You've all eaten an applein the last week, I'm sure.How old do you think it wasfrom when it was picked?Two weeks?Two months?Eleven months —the average age of an applein a grocery store in the United States.And I don't expect itto be much different in Europeor anywhere else in the world.We pick them,we put them in cold storage,we gas the cold storage —there's actually documented proofof workers trying to gointo these environmentsto retrieve an apple,and dying,because the atmospherethat they slow down the processof the apple with is also toxic to humans. How is it that none of you knew this?Why didn't I know this?Ninety percent of the qualityof that apple —all of the antioxidants — are goneby the time we get it.It's basically a little ball of sugar.How did we get so information poorand how can we do better? I think what's missing is a platform.I know platforms — I know computers,they put me on the Internetwhen I was young.I did very weird things —n(Laughter) on this platform.But I met people,and I could express myself. How do you express yourself in food?If we had a platform,we might feel empoweredto question: What if?For me, I questioned:What if climate was democratic?So, this is a map of climate in the world.The most productive areas in green,the least productive in red.They shift and they change,and Californian farmersnow become Mexican farmers.China picks up land in Brazilto grow better food,and we're a slave to climate.What if each country hadits own productive climate?What would that change about how we live?What would that changeabout quality of life and nutrition? The last generation's problemwas, we need more foodand we need it cheap.Welcome to your global farm.We built a huge analog farm.All these traces —these are cars, planes,trains and automobiles.It's a miracle that we feedseven billion peoplewith just a few of us involvedin the production of food. What if ...we built a digital farm?A digital world farm.What if you could take this apple,digitize it somehow,send it through particles in the airand reconstitute it on the other side?What if? Going through some of these quotes,you know, they inspire me to do what I do. First one:n[\"Japanese farming has no youth,no water, no land and no future.\"]nThat's what I landed to the daythat I went to Minamisanriku,one stop south of Fukushima,after the disaster.The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo,the land is contaminated,they already import 70 percentof their own food.But it's not unique to Japan.Two percent of the American populationis involved in farming.What good answer comesfrom two percent of any population?As we go around the world,50 percent of the Africanpopulation is under 18.Eighty percent don't want to be farmers.Farming is hard.The life of a small-shareholderfarmer is miserable.They go into the city.In India:farmers' families not being ableto have basic access to utilities,more farmer suicides this yearand the previous 10 before that.It's uncomfortable to talk about.Where are they going?Into the city.No young people, and everyone's headed in.So how do we build this platformthat inspires the youth? Welcome to the new tractor.This is my combine.A number of years ago now,I went to Bed Bath and Beyondand Home Depotand I started hacking.And I built silly thingsand I made plants danceand I attached them to my computerand I killed them all —a lot. (Laughter) I eventually got them to survive.And I created one of the mostintimate relationshipsI've ever had in my life,because I was learningthe language of plants.I wanted to make it bigger.They said, \"Knock yourself out, kid!Here's an old electronics roomthat nobody wants.What can you do?\"nWith my team, we built a farminside of the media lab,a place historically knownnot for anything about biologybut everything about digital life.Inside of these 60 square feet,we produced enough food to feedabout 300 people once a month —not a lot of food.And there's a lot of interestingtechnology in there.But the most interesting thing?Beautiful, white roots,deep, green colorsand a monthly harvest.Is this a new cafeteria?Is this a new retail experience?Is this a new grocery store?I can tell you one thing for sure:this is the first timeanybody in the media labripped the roots off of anything. (Laughter) We get our salad in bags;there's nothing wrong with that.But what happenswhen you have an image-basedprocessing expert,a data scientist,a roboticist,ripping roots off and thinking,\"Huh. I know something about —I could make this happen, I want to try.\"nIn that process we wouldbring the plants outand we would take some back to the lab,because if you grew it,you don't throw it away;it's kind of precious to you.I have this weird tongue now,because I'm afraid to let anybody eatanything until I've eaten it first,because I want it to be good.So I eat lettuce every dayand I can tell the pHof a lettuce within .1. (Laughter) I'm like, \"No, that's 6.1 — no,no, you can't eat it today.\"n(Applause) This lettuce that day was hyper sweet.It was hyper sweetbecause the plant had been stressedand it created a chemical reactionin the plant to protect itself:\"I'm not going to die!\"And the plants not-going-to-die,taste sweet to me.Technologists falling backwardsinto plant physiology. So we thought other peopleneeded to be able to try this.We want to see what people can create,so we conceived of a labthat could be shipped anywhere.And then we built it. So on the facadeof the media lab is my lab,that has about 30 pointsof sensing per plant.If you know about the genome or genetics,this is the phenome, right?The phenomena.When you say, \"I likethe strawberries from Mexico,\"you really like the strawberriesfrom the climatethat produced the expressionthat you like.So if you're coding climate —this much CO2, this much O2 createsa recipe — you're codingthe expression of that plant,the nutrition of that plant,the size of that plant, the shape,the color, the texture.We need data,so we put a bunch of sensors in thereto tell us what's going on. If you think of your houseplants,and you look at your houseplantand you're super sad, because you're like,\"Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?\"n(Laughter) Farmers develop the most beautifulfortune-telling eyesby the time they're in theirlate 60s and 70s.They can tell you when yousee that plant dyingthat it's a nitrogen deficiency,a calcium deficiencyor it needs more humidity.Those beautiful eyesare not being passed down. These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer.We trend those data points over time.We correlate those data pointsto individual plants.These are all the broccoliin my lab that day, by IP address. (Laughter) We have IP-addressable broccoli. (Applause) So if that's not weird enough,you can click oneand you get a plant profile.And what this tells youis downloadable progress on that plant,but not like you'd think,it's not just when it's ready.When does it achievethe nutrition that I need?When does it achievethe taste that I desire?Is it getting too much water?Is it getting too much sun?Alerts.It can talk to me, it's conversant,we have a language. (Laughter) (Applause) I think of that as the first useron the plant Facebook, right?That's a plant profileand that plant will start making friends. (Laughter) And I mean it — it will makefriends with other plantsthat use less nitrogen, more phosphorus,less potassium.We're going to learn about a complexitythat we can only guess at now.And they may not friend us back —I don't know, they might friend us back,it depends on how we act. So this is my lab now.It's a little bit more systematized,my background is designing data centersin hospitals of all things,so I know a little bit about creatinga controlled environment. And so —inside of this environment,we're experimentingwith all kinds of things.This process, aeroponics, was developedby NASA for Mir Space Stationfor reducing the amount of waterthey send into space.What it really does is give the plantexactly what it wants:water, minerals and oxygen.Roots are not that complicated,so when you give them that,you get this amazing expression.It's like the plant has two hearts.And because it has two hearts,it grows four or five times faster.It's a perfect world.We've gone a long way into technologyand seed for an adverse worldand we're going to continue to do that,but we're going to have a new tool, too,which is perfect world. So we've grown all kinds of things.These tomatoes hadn't beenin commercial production for 150 years.Do you know that we haverare and ancient seed banks?Banks of seed.It's amazing.They have germplasm aliveand things that you've never eaten.I am the only person in this roomthat's eaten that kind of tomato.Problem is it was a sauce tomatoand we don't know how to cook,so we ate a sauce tomato,which is not that great.But we've done things with protein —we've grown all kinds of things.We've grown humans —n(Laughter) Well maybe you could, but we didn't. But what we realized is,the tool was too big,it was too expensive.I was starting to put themaround the worldand they were about 100,000 dollars.Finding somebody with 100 grandin their back pocket isn't easy,so we wanted to make a small one. This project was actuallyone of my student's —mechanical engineeringundergraduate, Camille.So Camille and I and my team,we iterated all summer,how to make it cheaper,how to make it work better,how to make it so otherpeople can make it.Then we dropped them off in schools,seventh through eleventh grade.And if you want to be humbled,try to teach a kid something. So I went into this school and I said,\"Set it to 65 percent humidity.\"nThe seventh gradersaid, \"What's humidity?\"nAnd I said, \"Oh, it's water in air.\"nHe said, \"There's no waterin air, you're an idiot.\"n(Laughter) And I was like, \"Alright, don't trust me.Actually — don't trust me, right?Set it to 100.He sets it to 100 and what happens?It starts to condense, make a fogand eventually drip. And he says, \"Oh. Humidity is rain.Why didn't you just tell me that?\"n(Laughter) We've created an interfacefor this that's much like a game.They have a 3D environment,they can log into it anywhere in the worldon their smartphone, on their tablet.They have different parts of the bots —the physical, the sensors.They select recipes that havebeen created by other kidsanywhere in the world.They select and activate that recipe,they plant a seedling.While it's growing, they make changes.They're like, \"Why does a plantneed CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad?It kills people.\"Crank up CO2, plant dies.Or crank down CO2, plant does very well.Harvest plant,and you've created a new digital recipe. It's an iterative design and developmentand exploration process.They can download, then,all of the data about that new plantthat they developedor the new digital recipeand what did it do —was it better or was it worse?Imagine these as little coresof processing.We're going to learn so much. Here's one of the food computers,as we call them,in a school in three weeks' time.This is three weeks of growth.But more importantly,it was the first time that this kidever thought he could be a farmer —or that he would want to be a farmer. So, we've open-sourced all of this.It's all online; go home, try to buildyour first food computer.It's going to be difficult —I'm just telling you.We're in the beginning,but it's all there.It's very important to methat this is easily accessible.We're going to keep making it more so. These are farmers,electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,environmental engineer,computer scientist,plant scientist,economist, urban planners.On one platform, doingwhat they're good at.But we got a little too big. This is my new facilitythat I'm just starting.This warehouse could be anywhere.That's why I chose it.And inside of this warehousewe're going to build somethingkind of like this.These exist right now.Take a look at it.These exist, too.One grows greens,one grows Ebola vaccine.Pretty amazing that plantsand this DARPA Grand Challenge winneris one of the reasonswe're getting ahead of Ebola.The plants are producingthe protein that's Ebola resistant.So pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals,all they way down to lettuce. But these two things look nothing alike,and that's where I am with my field.Everything is different.We're in that weird \"We're alright\" stageand it's like, \"Here's my black box —\"\"No, buy mine.\"\"No, no, no — I've got intellectualproperty that's totally valuable.Don't buy his, buy mine.\"nAnd the reality is,we're just at the beginning,in a time when society is shifting, too.When we ask for more, cheaper food,we're now asking for better,environmentally friendly food.And when you have McDonald's advertisingwhat's in the Chicken McNugget,the most mysteriousfood item of all time —they are now basingtheir marketing plan on that —everything is changing. So into the world now.Personal food computers,food serversand food data centersrun on the open phenome.Think open genome, but we're goingto put little climate recipes,like Wikipedia,that you can pull down, actuate and grow. What does this look like in a world?You remember the worldconnected by strings?We start having beacons.We start sending information about food,rather than sending food.This is not just my fantasy,this is where we're already deploying.Food computers, food servers,soon-to-be food data centers,connecting people togetherto share information. The future of food is not about fightingover what's wrong with this.We know what's wrong with this.The future of food is about networkingthe next one billion farmersand empowering them with a platformto ask and answer the question,\"What if?\"nThank you. (Applause) What if we could grow delicious, nutrient-dense food, indoors anywhere in the world?
