This webscraping exercise extracted, cleaned and gathered a list of transcripts for each presentation related to "innovation" on Ted Talk. Once we had the transcripts (documents) and then combined them into a corpus, we exported it in txt and passed it down to a data-driven ontology editor, i.e. OntoGen, for ontology creation. OntoGen applied Support-Vector-Machine (SVM) to analyze the imported corpus, and subsequently found common concepts/themes among the documents (see "Innovation_TedTalks_Ontology (results from OntoGen).png" for a sample illustration). 

The objective of this webscraping (in R) + text mining (using OntoGen) exercise was to find common concepts/ideas about "innovation" from a series of Ted Talk presentations - i.e. how and what did people define, talk about "innovation"?
